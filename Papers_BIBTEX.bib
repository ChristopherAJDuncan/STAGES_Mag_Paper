title = {Cosmological information in Gaussianized weak lensing signals},
abstract = {Gaussianizing the one-point distribution of the weak gravitational lensing convergence has recently been shown to increase the signal-to-noise ratio contained in two-point statistics. We investigate the information on cosmology that can be extracted from the transformed convergence fields. Employing Box-Cox transformations to determine optimal transformations to Gaussianity, we develop analytical models for the transformed power spectrum, including effects of noise and smoothing. We find that optimized Box-Cox transformations perform substantially better than an offset logarithmic transformation in Gaussianizing the convergence, but both yield very similar results for the signal-to-noise ratio. None of the transformations is capable of eliminating correlations of the power spectra between different angular frequencies, which we demonstrate to have a significant impact on the errors in cosmology. Analytic models of the Gaussianized power spectrum yield good fits to the simulations and produce unbiased parameter estimates in the majority of cases, where the exceptions can be traced back to the limitations in modelling the higher order correlations of the original convergence. In the ideal case, without galaxy shape noise, we find an increase in the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 2.6 for angular frequencies up to ℓ= 1500, and a decrease in the area of the confidence region in the Ωm-σ8 plane, measured in terms of q-values, by a factor of 4.4 for the best performing transformation. When adding a realistic level of shape noise, all transformations perform poorly with little decorrelation of angular frequencies, a maximum increase in signal-to-noise ratio of 34 per cent, and even slightly degraded errors on cosmological parameters. We argue that to find Gaussianizing transformations of practical use, it will be necessary to go beyond transformations of the one-point distribution of the convergence, extend the analysis deeper into the non-linear regime and resort to an exploration of parameter space via simulations.},

title = {Cross-correlation of spectroscopic and photometric galaxy surveys: cosmology from lensing and redshift distortions},
abstract = {Cosmological galaxy surveys aim at mapping the largest volumes to test models with techniques such as cluster abundance, cosmic shear correlations or baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), which are designed to be independent of galaxy bias. Here, we explore an alternative route to constrain cosmology: sampling more moderate volumes with the cross-correlation of photometric and spectroscopic surveys. We consider the angular galaxy-galaxy auto-correlation in narrow redshift bins and its combination with different probes of weak gravitational lensing (WL) and redshift space distortions (RSD). Including the cross-correlation of these surveys improves by factors of a few the constraints on both the dark energy equation of state w(z) and the cosmic growth history, parametrized by γ. The additional information comes from using many narrow redshift bins and from measurement of galaxy bias with both WL and RSD, breaking degeneracies that are present when using each method separately. We show forecasts for a joint w(z) and γ figure of merit (FoM?) using linear scales over a deep (iAB < 24) photometric survey and a brighter (iAB < 22.5) spectroscopic or very accurate (0.3 per cent) photometric redshift survey. Magnification or shear in the photometric sample produce FoM? that are of the same order of magnitude of those of RSD or BAO over the spectroscopic sample. However, the cross-correlation of these probes over the same area yields a FoM? that is up to a factor of 100 times larger. Magnification alone, without shape measurements, can also be used for these cross-correlations and can produce better results than using shear alone. For a spectroscopic follow-up survey strategy, measuring the spectra of the foreground lenses to perform this cross-correlation provides five times better FoM? than targeting the higher redshift tail of the galaxy distribution to study BAO over a 2.5 times larger volume.},

title = {Magnificent Magnification: Exploiting the Other Half of the Lensing Signal},
abstract = {We describe a new method for measuring galaxy magnification due to weak gravitational lensing. Our method makes use of a tight scaling relation between galaxy properties that are modified by gravitational lensing, such as apparent size, and other properties that are not, such as surface brightness. In particular, we use a version of the well-known fundamental plane relation for early type galaxies. This modified "photometric fundamental plane" replaces velocity dispersions with photometric galaxy properties, thus obviating the need for spectroscopic data. We present the first detection of magnification using this method by applying it to photometric catalogs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This analysis shows that the derived magnification signal is comparable to that available from conventional methods using gravitational shear. We suppress the dominant sources of systematic error and discuss modest improvements that may allow this method to equal or even surpass the signal-to-noise achievable with shear. Moreover, some of the dominant sources of systematic error are substantially different from those of shear-based techniques. Thus, combining the two techniques addresses the major weaknesses of each and provides a substantial improvement over either method used in isolation. With this new technique, magnification becomes a necessary measurement tool for the coming era of large ground-based surveys intending to measure gravitational lensing.},

title = {A Detection of Weak-lensing Magnification Using Galaxy Sizes and Magnitudes},
abstract = {Weak lensing is commonly measured using shear through galaxy ellipticities or using the effect of magnification bias on galaxy number densities. Here, we report on the first detection of weak-lensing magnification with a new, independent technique using the distribution of galaxy sizes and magnitudes. These data come for free in galaxy surveys designed for measuring shear. We present the magnification estimator and apply it to an X-ray-selected sample of galaxy groups in the COSMOS Hubble Space Telescope survey. The measurement of the projected surface density Σ(r) is consistent with the shear measurements within the uncertainties and has roughly 40% of the signal to noise of the latter. We discuss systematic issues and challenges to realizing the potential of this new probe of weak lensing.},

title = {Image analysis for cosmology: results from the GREAT10 Galaxy Challenge},
abstract = {In this paper, we present results from the weak-lensing shape measurement GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing 2010 (GREAT10) Galaxy Challenge. This marks an order of magnitude step change in the level of scrutiny employed in weak-lensing shape measurement analysis. We provide descriptions of each method tested and include 10 evaluation metrics over 24 simulation branches. GREAT10 was the first shape measurement challenge to include variable fields; both the shear field and the point spread function (PSF) vary across the images in a realistic manner. The variable fields enable a variety of metrics that are inaccessible to constant shear simulations, including a direct measure of the impact of shape measurement inaccuracies, and the impact of PSF size and ellipticity, on the shear power spectrum. To assess the impact of shape measurement bias for cosmic shear, we present a general pseudo-Cℓ formalism that propagates spatially varying systematics in cosmic shear through to power spectrum estimates. We also show how one-point estimators of bias can be extracted from variable shear simulations. The GREAT10 Galaxy Challenge received 95 submissions and saw a factor of 3 improvement in the accuracy achieved by other shape measurement methods. The best methods achieve sub-per cent average biases. We find a strong dependence on accuracy as a function of signal-to-noise ratio, and indications of a weak dependence on galaxy type and size. Some requirements for the most ambitious cosmic shear experiments are met above a signal-to-noise ratio of 20. These results have the caveat that the simulated PSF was a ground-based PSF. Our results are a snapshot of the accuracy of current shape measurement methods and are a benchmark upon which improvement can be brought. This provides a foundation for a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of shape measurement methods.},

abstract = {The GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing 2008 (GREAT08) Challenge focuses on a problem that is of crucial importance for future observations in cosmology. The shapes of distant galaxies can be used to determine the properties of dark energy and the nature of gravity, because light from those galaxies is bent by gravity from the intervening dark matter. The observed galaxy images appear distorted, although only slightly, and their shapes must be precisely disentangled from the effects of pixelisation, convolution and noise. The worldwide gravitational lensing community has made significant progress in techniques to measure these distortions via the Shear TEsting Program (STEP). Via STEP, we have run challenges within our own community, and come to recognise that this particular image analysis problem is ideally matched to experts in statistical inference, inverse problems and computational learning. Thus, in order to continue the progress seen in recent years, we are seeking an infusion of new ideas from these communities. This document details the GREAT08 Challenge for potential participants.

title = {CARS: The CFHTLS-Archive-Research Survey. III. First detection of cosmic magnification in samples of normal high-z galaxies},
abstract = {Context: Weak gravitational lensing (WL) has been established as one of the most promising probes of cosmology. So far, most studies have exploited the shear effect of WL leading to coherent distortions of galaxy shapes. WL also introduces coherent magnifications. Aims: We want to detect this cosmic magnification effect (coherent magnification by the large-scale structure of the Universe) in large samples of high-redshift galaxies selected from the Deep part of the Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). Methods: Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) selected by their colours to be at z= 2.5-5, are used as a background sample and are cross-correlated to foreground lens galaxies, which are selected by accurate photometric redshifts (photo-z's). The signals of LBGs in different magnitude bins are compared to predictions from WL theory. An optimally weighted correlation function is estimated by taking into account the slope of external LBG luminosity functions. Results: For the first time, we detect cosmic magnification in a sample of normal galaxies. These background sources are also the ones with the highest redshifts so far used for WL measurements. The amplitude and angular dependence of the cross-correlation functions agree well with theoretical expectations and the lensing signal is detected with high significance. Avoiding low-redshift ranges in the foreground samples which might contaminate the LBG samples we can make a measurement that is virtually free of systematics. In particular, we detect an anti-correlation between faint LBGs and foreground galaxies which cannot be caused by redshift overlap. Conclusions: Cross-correlating LBGs (and in future also photo-z selected galaxies) as background sources to well understood foreground samples based on accurate photo-z's will become a powerful cosmological probe in future large imaging surveys.

abstract = {We investigate the extent to which the pure magnification effect of gravitational lensing can be extracted from galaxy clustering statistics, by a nulling method which aims to eliminate terms arising from the intrinsic clustering of galaxies. The aim is to leave statistics which are free from the uncertainties of galaxy bias. We find that nulling can be done effectively, leaving data which are relatively insensitive to uncertainties in galaxy bias and its evolution, leading to cosmological parameter estimation which is effectively unbiased. This advantage comes at the expense of increased statistical errors, which are in some cases large, but it offers a robust alternative analysis method to cosmic shear for cosmological imaging surveys designed for weak-lensing studies, or to full modelling of the clustering signal including magnification effects.},

abstract = {A likelihood-based method for measuring weak gravitational lensing shear in deep galaxy surveys is described and applied to the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). CFHTLenS comprises 154 deg2 of multi-colour optical data from the CFHT Legacy Survey, with lensing measurements being made in the i' band to a depth i'AB < 24.7, for galaxies with signal-to-noise ratio νSN ≳ 10. The method is based on the lensfit algorithm described in earlier papers, but here we describe a full analysis pipeline that takes into account the properties of real surveys. The method creates pixel-based models of the varying point spread function (PSF) in individual image exposures. It fits PSF-convolved two-component (disc plus bulge) models to measure the ellipticity of each galaxy, with Bayesian marginalization over model nuisance parameters of galaxy position, size, brightness and bulge fraction. The method allows optimal joint measurement of multiple, dithered image exposures, taking into account imaging distortion and the alignment of the multiple measurements. We discuss the effects of noise bias on the likelihood distribution of galaxy ellipticity. Two sets of image simulations that mirror the observed properties of CFHTLenS have been created to establish the method's accuracy and to derive an empirical correction for the effects of noise bias.},

abstract = {The Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) comprises deep multicolour (u*g'r'i'z') photometry spanning 154 deg2, with accurate photometric redshifts and shape measurements. We demonstrate that the redshift probability distribution function summed over galaxies provides an accurate representation of the galaxy redshift distribution accounting for random and catastrophic errors for galaxies with best-fitting photometric redshifts zp < 1.3. We present cosmological constraints using tomographic weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure. We use two broad redshift bins 0.5 < zp ≤ 0.85 and 0.85 < zp ≤ 1.3 free of intrinsic alignment contamination, and measure the shear correlation function on angular scales in the range ˜1-40 arcmin. We show that the problematic redshift scaling of the shear signal, found in previous Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey data analyses, does not affect the CFHTLenS data. For a flat Λ cold dark matter model and a fixed matter density Ωm = 0.27, we find the normalization of the matter power spectrum σ8 = 0.771 $\pm$ 0.041. When combined with cosmic microwave background data (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7-year results), baryon acoustic oscillation data (BOSS) and a prior on the Hubble constant from the Hubble Space Telescope distance ladder, we find that CFHTLenS improves the precision of the fully marginalized parameter estimates by an average factor of 1.5-2. Combining our results with the above cosmological probes, we find Ωm = 0.2762 $\pm$ 0.0074 and σ8 = 0.802 $\pm$ 0.013.},

title = {Size magnification as a complement to cosmic shear},
abstract = {We investigate the extent to which cosmic size magnification may be used to complement cosmic shear in weak gravitational lensing surveys, with a view to obtaining high-precision estimates of cosmological parameters. Using simulated galaxy images, we find that unbiased estimation of the convergence field is possible using galaxies with angular sizes larger than the point spread function (PSF) and signal-to-noise ratio in excess of 10. The statistical power is similar to, but not quite as good as, cosmic shear, and it is subject to different systematic effects. Application to ground-based data will be challenging, with relatively large empirical corrections required to account for the fact that many galaxies are smaller than the PSF, but for space-based data with 0.1-0.2 arcsec resolution, the size distribution of galaxies brighter than i ≃ 24 is almost ideal for accurate estimation of cosmic size magnification.},

title = {Detection of Cosmic Magnification with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey},
abstract = {We present an 8 σ detection of cosmic magnification measured by the variation of quasar density due to gravitational lensing by foreground large-scale structure. To make this measurement we used 3800 deg2 of photometric observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) containing ~200,000 quasars and 13 million galaxies. Our measurement of the galaxy-quasar cross-correlation function exhibits the amplitude, angular dependence, and change in sign as a function of the slope of the observed quasar number counts that is expected from magnification bias due to weak gravitational lensing. We show that observational uncertainties (stellar contamination, Galactic dust extinction, seeing variations, and errors in the photometric redshifts) are well controlled and do not significantly affect the lensing signal. By weighting the quasars with the number count slope, we combine the cross-correlation of quasars for our full magnitude range and detect the lensing signal at >4 σ in all five SDSS filters. Our measurements of cosmic magnification probe scales ranging from 60 h-1 kpc to 10 h-1 Mpc and are in good agreement with theoretical predictions based on the WMAP concordance cosmology. As with galaxy-galaxy lensing, future measurements of cosmic magnification will provide useful constraints on the galaxy-mass power spectrum.},

title = {Probing dark energy with the shear-ratio geometric test},
abstract = {We adapt the Jain-Taylor (2003) shear-ratio geometric lensing method to measure the dark energy equation of state, w = pv/ρv and its time derivative from dark matter haloes in cosmologies with arbitrary spatial curvature. The full shear-ratio covariance matrix is calculated for lensed sources, including the intervening large-scale structure and photometric redshift errors as additional sources of noise, and a maximum likelihood method for applying the test is presented. Decomposing the lensing matter distribution into dark matter haloes we calculate the parameter covariance matrix for an arbitrary experiment. Combining with the expected results from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) we design an optimal survey for probing dark energy. This shows that a targeted survey imaging 60 of the largest clusters in a hemisphere with five-band optical photometric redshifts to a median galaxy depth of zm = 0.9 could measure w0 ≡ w(z = 0) to a marginal 1σ error of Δw0 = 0.5. We marginalize over all other parameters including wa, where the equation of state is parametrized in terms of scalefactor a as w(a) = w0 + wa(1 - a). For higher accuracy a large-scale photometric redshift survey is required, where the largest gain in signal arises from the numerous ~1014Msolar haloes corresponding to medium-sized galaxy clusters. Combined with the expected Planck Surveyor results, such a near-future five-band survey covering 10000 deg2 to zm = 0.7 could measure w0 to Δw0 = 0.075 and Δwa = 0.33. A stronger combined constraint is put on w measured at the pivot redshift zp = 0.27 of Δw(zp) = 0.0298. We compare and combine the geometric test with the cosmological and dark energy parameters measured from planned baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and supernova Type Ia experiments, and find that the geometric test results combine with a significant reduction in errors due to different degeneracies. A combination of geometric lensing, CMB and BAO experiments could achieve Δw0 = 0.047 and Δwa = 0.111 with a pivot redshift constraint of Δw(zp) = 0.020 at zp = 0.62. Simple relations are presented that show how our lensing results can be scaled to other telescope classes and survey parameters.},

The article presents our data processing of the complete CFHTLenS data set. We were able to obtain a data set with very good image quality and high-quality astrometric and photometric calibration. Our external astrometric accuracy is between 60-70 mas with respect to SDSS data and the internal alignment in all filters is around 30 mas. Our average photometric calibration shows a dispersion on the order of 0.01 to 0.03 mag for g'r'i'z' and about 0.04 mag for u^* with respect to SDSS sources down to i <= 21. In the spirit of the CFHTLS all our data products are released to the astronomical community via the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre.

title = {Karhunen-Loeve Eigenvalue Problems in Cosmology: How Should We Tackle Large Data Sets?},
abstract = {Since cosmology is no longer "the data-starved science," the problem of how to analyze large data sets best has recently received considerable attention, and Karhunen-Loeve eigenvalue methods have been applied to both galaxy redshift surveys and cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps. We present a comprehensive discussion of methods for estimating cosmological parameters from large data sets, which includes the previously published techniques as special cases. We show that both the problem of estimating several parameters jointly and the problem of not knowing the parameters a priori can be readily solved by adding an extra singular value decomposition step. It has recently been argued that the information content in a sky map from a next-generation CMB satellite is sufficient to measure key cosmological parameters (h, Omega , Lamda , etc.) to an accuracy of a few percent or better---in principle. In practice, the data set is so large that both a brute force likelihood analysis and a direct expansion in signal-to-noise eigenmodes will be computationally unfeasible. We argue that it is likely that a Karhunen-Loeve approach can nonetheless measure the parameters with close to maximal accuracy, if preceded by an appropriate form of quadratic "precompression." We also discuss practical issues regarding parameter estimation from present and future galaxy redshift surveys and illustrate this with a generalized eigenmode analysis of the IRAS 1.2 Jy survey optimized for measuring beta = Omega 0.6/b using redshift space distortions.},

They are based upon a physically well-motivated separation of the effects of acoustic oscillations, Compton drag, velocity overshoot, baryon infall, adiabatic damping, Silk damping, and cold dark matter growth suppression. We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better motivated form for the zero-baryon transfer function than previous works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction Omega b/ Omega 0 >~ Omega 0h2 + 0.2, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon. We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter Gamma .},

title = {CFHTLenS: improving the quality of photometric redshifts with precision photometry},
abstract = {Here we present the results of various approaches to measure accurate colours and photometric redshifts (photo-z) from wide-field imaging data. We use data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey which have been re-processed by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) team in order to carry out a number of weak gravitational lensing studies. An emphasis is put on the correction of systematic effects in the photo-z arising from the different point spread functions (PSFs) in the five optical bands. Different ways of correcting these effects are discussed and the resulting photo-z accuracies are quantified by comparing the photo-z to large spectroscopic redshift (spec-z) data sets. Careful homogenization of the PSF between bands leads to increased overall accuracy of photo-z. The gain is particularly pronounced at fainter magnitudes where galaxies are smaller and flux measurements are affected more by PSF effects. We discuss ways of defining more secure subsamples of galaxies as well as a shape- and colour-based star-galaxy separation method, and we present redshift distributions for different magnitude limits. We also study possible re-calibrations of the photometric zero-points (ZPs) with the help of galaxies with known spec-z. We find that if PSF effects are properly taken into account, a re-calibration of the ZPs becomes much less important suggesting that previous such re-calibrations described in the literature could in fact be mostly corrections for PSF effects rather than corrections for real inaccuracies in the ZPs. The implications of this finding for future surveys like the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS), Dark Energy Survey (DES), Large Synoptic Survey Telescope or Euclid are mixed. On the one hand, ZP re-calibrations with spec-z values might not be as accurate as previously thought. On the other hand, careful PSF homogenization might provide a way out and yield accurate, homogeneous photometry without the need for full spectroscopic coverage. This is the first paper in a series describing the technical aspects of CFHTLenS.},

title = {CFHTLenS tomographic weak lensing cosmological parameter constraints: Mitigating the impact of intrinsic galaxy alignments},
abstract = {We present a finely-binned tomographic weak lensing analysis of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey, CFHTLenS, mitigating contamination to the signal from the presence of intrinsic galaxy alignments via the simultaneous fit of a cosmological model and an intrinsic alignment model. CFHTLenS spans 154 square degrees in five optical bands, with accurate shear and photometric redshifts for a galaxy sample with a median redshift of zm =0.70. We estimate the 21 sets of cosmic shear correlation functions associated with six redshift bins, each spanning the angular range of 1.5<theta<35 arcmin. We combine this CFHTLenS data with auxiliary cosmological probes: the cosmic microwave background with data from WMAP7, baryon acoustic oscillations with data from BOSS, and a prior on the Hubble constant from the HST distance ladder. This leads to constraints on the normalisation of the matter power spectrum sigma_8 = 0.799 +/- 0.015 and the matter density parameter Omega_m = 0.271 +/- 0.010 for a flat Lambda CDM cosmology. For a flat wCDM cosmology we constrain the dark energy equation of state parameter w = -1.02 +/- 0.09. We also provide constraints for curved Lambda CDM and wCDM cosmologies. We find the intrinsic alignment contamination to be galaxy-type dependent with a significant intrinsic alignment signal found for early-type galaxies, in contrast to the late-type galaxy sample for which the intrinsic alignment signal is found to be consistent with zero.},

title = {Shear and magnification: cosmic complementarity},
abstract = {The potential of cosmic shear to probe cosmology is well recognized and future optical wide field surveys are currently being designed to optimize the return of cosmic shear science. High precision cosmic shear analysis requires high precision photometric redshift. With accurate photometric redshifts, it becomes possible to measure the cosmic magnification on galaxies by galaxies and use it as a probe of cosmology. This type of weak lensing measurement will not use galaxy shapes, instead it will strongly rely on precise photometry and detailed colour information. In this work it is shown that such a measurement would lead to competitive constraints of the cosmological parameters, with a remarkable complementarity with cosmic shear. Future cosmic shear surveys could gain tremendously from magnification measurements as an independent probe of the dark matter distribution leading to a better control of observational and theoretical systematics when combined with shear.},

title = {Deconstructing Baryon Acoustic Oscillations: A Comparison of Methods},
abstract = {The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) or baryon wiggles which are present in the galaxy power spectrum at scales 100-150Mpc/h are powerful features with which to constrain cosmology. The potential of these probes is such that these are now included as primary science goals in the planning of several future galaxy surveys. However, there is not a uniquely defined BAO Method in the literature but a range of implementations. We study the assumptions and cosmological performances of three different BAO methods: the full Fourier space power spectrum [P(k)], the `wiggles only' in Fourier space and the spherical harmonics power spectrum [C(l)]. We contrast the power of each method to constrain cosmology for two fiducial surveys taken from the Dark Energy Task Force (DETF) report and equivalent to future ground and space based spectroscopic surveys. We find that, depending on the assumptions used, the dark energy Figure of Merit (FoM) can change by up to a factor of 35 for a given fiducial model and survey. We compare our results with the DETF implementation and, discuss the robustness of each probe, by quantifying the dependence of the FoM with the wavenumber range. The more information used by a method, the higher its statistical performance, but the higher its sensitivity to systematics and implementations details.},

title = {Simultaneous measurement of cosmology and intrinsic alignments using joint cosmic shear and galaxy number density correlations},
abstract = {Aims: Cosmic shear is a powerful method to constrain cosmology, provided that any systematic effects are under control. The intrinsic alignment of galaxies is expected to severely bias parameter estimates if not taken into account. We explore the potential of a joint analysis of tomographic galaxy ellipticity, galaxy number density, and ellipticity-number density cross-correlations to simultaneously constrain cosmology and self-calibrate unknown intrinsic alignment and galaxy bias contributions. Methods: We treat intrinsic alignments and galaxy biasing as free functions of scale and redshift and marginalise over the resulting parameter sets. Constraints on cosmology are calculated by combining the likelihoods from all two-point correlations between galaxy ellipticity and galaxy number density. The information required for these calculations is already available in a standard cosmic shear data set. We include contributions to these functions from cosmic shear, intrinsic alignments, galaxy clustering and magnification effects. Results: In a Fisher matrix analysis we compare our constraints with those from cosmic shear alone in the absence of intrinsic alignments. For a potential future large area survey, such as Euclid, the extra information from the additional correlation functions can make up for the additional free parameters in the intrinsic alignment and galaxy bias terms, depending on the flexibility in the models. For example, the dark energy task force figure of merit is recovered even when more than 100 free parameters are marginalised over. We find that the redshift quality requirements are similar to those calculated in the absence of intrinsic alignments.},

title = {Gravitational Lensing of Distant Field Galaxies by Rich Clusters - Part One - Faint Galaxy Redshift Distributions},
abstract = {From deep optical images of three clusters, selected by virtue of their X-ray luminosity and/or optical richness (1455 + 22, z = 0.26; 0016+16, z = 0.55; 1603 + 43, z = 0.89), we construct statistically complete samples of faint field galaxies (I <= 25) that are suitable for probing the effects of gravitational lensing. By selecting clusters across a wide redshift range, we separate the effects of the mean redshift of the faint field population well beyond spectroscopic limits and the distribution of dark matter in the lensing clusters. A significant lensing signature is seen in the two lower redshift clusters, whose X-ray properties are well constrained. Based on these and dynamical data, it is straightforward to rule out field redshift distributions for I <= 25, which have a significant low-redshift excess compared to the no-evolution prediction, such as would be expected if the number counts at faint limits were dominated by low-z dwarf systems. The degree to which we can constrain any high-redshift tail to the no-evolution redshift distribution depends on the distribution of mass in the most distant lensing cluster. In the second paper in this series, we demonstrate that the mass distributions in our lensing clusters are well understood, by reconstructing the full two-dimensional distributions from the lensing signal. The principal result is therefore the absence of a dominant low-z dwarf population to I <= 25.},

title = {Stable clustering, the halo model and non-linear cosmological power spectra},
abstract = {We present the results of a large library of cosmological N-body simulations, using power-law initial spectra. The non-linear evolution of the matter power spectra is compared with the predictions of existing analytic scaling formulae based on the work of Hamilton et al. The scaling approach has assumed that highly non-linear structures obey `stable clustering' and are frozen in proper coordinates. Our results show that, when transformed under the self-similarity scaling, the scale-free spectra define a non-linear locus that is clearly shallower than would be required under stable clustering. Furthermore, the small-scale non-linear power increases as both the power spectrum index n and the density parameter Ω decrease, and this evolution is not well accounted for by the previous scaling formulae. This breakdown of stable clustering can be understood as resulting from the modification of dark matter haloes by continuing mergers. These effects are naturally included in the analytic `halo model' for non-linear structure; we use this approach to fit both our scale-free results and also our previous cold dark matter data. This method is more accurate than the commonly used Peacock-Dodds formula and should be applicable to more general power spectra. Code to evaluate non-linear power spectra using this method is available from <externallink type="url">http://as1.chem.nottingham.ac.uk/~res/software.html</A>. Following publication, we will make the power-law simulation data publically available through the Virgo website <externallink type="url">http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/Virgo/</A>.},
