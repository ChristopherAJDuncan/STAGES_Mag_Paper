title = {How to evade the sample variance limit on measurements of redshift-space distortions},
abstract = {We show how to use multiple tracers of large-scale density with different biases to measure the redshift-space distortion parameter β ≡ b-1f ≡ b-1d ln D/d ln a (where D is the growth factor and a the expansion factor), to, as the signal-to-noise (S/N) of a survey increases, much better precision than one could achieve with a single tracer (to arbitrary precision in the low noise limit). In combination with the power spectrum of the tracers this would allow a more precise measurement of the bias-free velocity divergence power spectrum, f2Pm, with the ultimate, zero noise limit, being that f2Pm can be measured as well as would be possible if velocity divergence was observed directly, with maximum rms improvement factor ~ [5.2(β2+2β+2)/β2]1/2 (e.g., simeq 10 times better than a single tracer with β = 0.4). This would allow a determination of fD as a function of redshift with an error as low as ~ 0.1% (again, in the idealized case of the zero noise limit). The ratio b2/b1 can be determined with an even greater precision than β, potentially producing, when measured as a function of scale, an exquisitely sensitive probe of the onset of non-linear bias. We also extend in more detail previous work on the use of the same technique to measure non-Gaussianity. Currently planned redshift surveys are typically designed with S/N ~ 1 on scales of interest, which severely limits the usefulness of our method. Our results suggest that there are potentially large gains to be achieved from technological or theoretical developments that allow higher S/N, or, in the long term, surveys that simply observe a higher number density of galaxies.},

title = {Weak Gravitational Lensing as a Method to Constrain Unstable Dark Matter},
abstract = {The nature of the dark matter remains a mystery. The possibility of an unstable dark matter particle decaying to invisible daughter particles has been explored many times in the past few decades. Meanwhile, weak gravitational lensing shear has gained a lot of attention as a probe of dark energy. Weak lensing is a useful tool for constraining the stability of the dark matter. In the coming decade a number of large, galaxy imaging surveys will be undertaken and will measure the statistics of cosmological weak lensing with unprecedented precision. Weak lensing statistics are sensitive to unstable dark matter in at least two ways. Dark matter decays alter the matter power spectrum and change the angular diameter distance-redshift relation. We show how measurements of weak lensing shear correlations may provide the most restrictive, model-independent constraints on the lifetime of unstable dark matter. Our results rely on assumptions regarding nonlinear evolution of density fluctuations in scenarios of unstable dark matter and one of our aims is to stimulate interest in theoretical work on nonlinear structure growth in unstable dark matter models.},

title = {Looking at the Fundamental Plane through a Gravitational Lens},
abstract = {We consider the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies lensed by the gravitational field of a massive deflector (typically, a cluster of galaxies). We show that the fundamental plane relation provides a straightforward measurement of the projected mass distribution of the lens with a typical accuracy of ~0.15 in the dimensionless column density κ. The proposed technique breaks the mass-sheet degeneracy completely and is thus expected to serve as an important complement to other lensing-based analyses. Moreover, its ability to directly measure the mass distribution on the small pencil beams that characterize the size of background galaxies may lead to crucial tests for current scenarios of structure formation.},

title = {3D cosmic shear: cosmology from CFHTLenS},
abstract = {This paper presents the first application of 3D cosmic shear to a wide-field weak lensing survey. 3D cosmic shear is a technique that analyses weak lensing in three dimensions using a spherical harmonic approach, and does not bin data in the redshift direction. This is applied to CFHTLenS, a 154 square degree imaging survey with a median redshift of 0.7 and an effective number density of 11 galaxies per square arcminute usable for weak lensing. To account for survey masks we apply a 3D pseudo-Cℓ approach on weak lensing data, and to avoid uncertainties in the highly non-linear regime, we separately analyse radial wavenumbers k ≤ 1.5 and 5.0 h Mpc-1, and angular wavenumbers ℓ ≈ 400-5000. We show how one can recover 2D and tomographic power spectra from the full 3D cosmic shear power spectra and present a measurement of the 2D cosmic shear power spectrum, and measurements of a set of 2-bin and 6-bin cosmic shear tomographic power spectra; in doing so we find that using the 3D power in the calculation of such 2D and tomographic power spectra from data naturally accounts for a minimum scale in the matter power spectrum. We use 3D cosmic shear to constrain cosmologies with parameters ΩM, ΩB, σ8, h , ns, w0 and wa. For a non-evolving dark energy equation of state, and assuming a flat cosmology, lensing combined with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 results in h = 0.78 $\pm$ 0.12, ΩM = 0.252 $\pm$ 0.079, σ8 = 0.88 $\pm$ 0.23 and w = -1.16 $\pm$ 0.38 using only scales k ≤ 1.5 h Mpc-1. We also present results of lensing combined with first year Planck results, where we find no tension with the results from this analysis, but we also find no significant improvement over the Planck results alone. We find evidence of a suppression of power compared to Lambda cold dark matter (LCDM) on small scales 1.5 < k ≤ 5.0 h Mpc-1 in the lensing data, which is consistent with predictions of the effect of baryonic feedback on the matter power spectrum.},

abstract = {We present a high-resolution dark matter reconstruction of the z = 0.165 Abell 901/902 supercluster from a weak lensing analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope STAGES survey. We detect the four main structures of the supercluster at high significance, resolving substructure within and between the clusters. We find that the distribution of dark matter is well traced by the cluster galaxies, with the brightest cluster galaxies marking out the strongest peaks in the dark matter distribution. We also find a significant extension of the dark matter distribution of Abell 901a in the direction of an infalling X-ray group Abell 901α. We present mass, mass-to-light and mass-to-stellar mass ratio measurements of the structures and substructures that we detect. We find no evidence for variation of the mass-to-light and mass-to-stellar mass ratio between the different clusters. We compare our space-based lensing analysis with an earlier ground-based lensing analysis of the supercluster to demonstrate the importance of space-based imaging for future weak lensing dark matter `observations'.},

title = {Tomographic magnification of Lyman-break galaxies in the Deep Lens Survey},
abstract = {Using about 450 000 galaxies in the Deep Lens Survey, we present a detection of the gravitational magnification of z > 4 Lyman-break galaxies by massive foreground galaxies with 0.4 < z < 1.0, grouped by redshift. The magnification signal is detected at a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 20, and rigorous checks confirm that it is not contaminated by any galaxy sample overlap in redshift. The inferred galaxy mass profiles are consistent with earlier lensing analyses at lower redshift. We then explore the tomographic lens magnification signal by splitting our foreground galaxy sample into seven redshift bins. Combining galaxy-magnification cross-correlations and galaxy angular autocorrelations, we develop a bias-independent estimator of the tomographic signal. As a diagnostic of magnification tomography, the measurement of this estimator rejects a flat, dark matter-dominated universe at >7.5σ with a fixed σ8 and is found to be consistent with the expected redshift dependence of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 Λ cold dark matter cosmology.},

title = {Gravitational Lensing of Distant Field Galaxies by Rich Clusters - Part One - Faint Galaxy Redshift Distributions},
abstract = {From deep optical images of three clusters, selected by virtue of their X-ray luminosity and/or optical richness (1455 + 22, z = 0.26; 0016+16, z = 0.55; 1603 + 43, z = 0.89), we construct statistically complete samples of faint field galaxies (I <= 25) that are suitable for probing the effects of gravitational lensing. By selecting clusters across a wide redshift range, we separate the effects of the mean redshift of the faint field population well beyond spectroscopic limits and the distribution of dark matter in the lensing clusters. A significant lensing signature is seen in the two lower redshift clusters, whose X-ray properties are well constrained. Based on these and dynamical data, it is straightforward to rule out field redshift distributions for I <= 25, which have a significant low-redshift excess compared to the no-evolution prediction, such as would be expected if the number counts at faint limits were dominated by low-z dwarf systems. The degree to which we can constrain any high-redshift tail to the no-evolution redshift distribution depends on the distribution of mass in the most distant lensing cluster. In the second paper in this series, we demonstrate that the mass distributions in our lensing clusters are well understood, by reconstructing the full two-dimensional distributions from the lensing signal. The principal result is therefore the absence of a dominant low-z dwarf population to I <= 25.},

title = {Prospects for constraining the shape of non-Gaussianity with the scale-dependent bias},
abstract = {We consider whether the non-Gaussian scale-dependent halo bias can be used not only to constrain the local form of non-Gaussianity but also to distinguish among different shapes. In particular, we ask whether it can constrain the behavior of the primordial three-point function in the squeezed limit where one of the momenta is much smaller than the other two. This is potentially interesting since the observation of a three-point function with a squeezed limit that does not go like the local nor equilateral templates would be a signal of non-trivial dynamics during inflation. To this end we use the quasi-single field inflation model of Chen and Wang as a representative two-parameter model, where one parameter governs the amplitude of non-Gaussianity and the other the shape. We also perform a model-independent analysis by parametrizing the scale-dependent bias as a power-law on large scales, where the power is to be constrained from observations. We find that proposed large-scale structure surveys (with characteristics similar to the dark energy task force stage IV surveys) have the potential to distinguish among the squeezed limit behavior of different bispectrum shapes for a wide range of fiducial model parameters. Thus the halo bias can help discriminate between different models of inflation.},

title = {On statistical lensing and the anticorrelation between 2dF QSOs and foreground galaxies},
abstract = {We study the cross-correlation of Automated Plate Measurement and Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies with background quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) taken from the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey, and detect a significant (2.8σ) anticorrelation. The lack of a similar signal between stars in the 2dF survey and our galaxy samples gives us confidence that the anticorrelation is not due to a systematic error. The possibility that dust in the foreground galaxies could produce such an anticorrelation is marginally rejected, at the 2σ level, through consideration of the colours of QSOs behind these galaxies. It is possible that a dust model that obscures QSOs without reddening them, or preferentially discards reddened QSOs from the 2dF survey sample, could produce such an anticorrelation; however, such models are at odds with the positive QSO-galaxy correlations found at bright magnitudes by other authors. Our detection of a galaxy-QSO anticorrelation is consistent with the predictions of statistical lensing theory. When combined with earlier results that have reported a positive galaxy-QSO correlation, a consistent and compelling picture emerges that spans faint and bright QSO samples showing positive or negative correlations according to the QSO N(m) slope. We find that galaxies are highly anti-biased on small scales. We consider two models that use quite different descriptions of the lensing matter and find that they yield consistent predictions for the strength of galaxy bias on 0.1h-1Mpc scales of b~ 0.1 (for a ΛCDM cosmology). Whilst the slope of our power-law fit to the QSO-galaxy cross-correlation does not allow us to rule out a linear bias parameter, when we compare our measurement of b on 100h-1kpc scales to independent methods that determine b~ 1 on h-1Mpc scales, we conclude that bias, on these small scales, is scale-dependent. These results indicate that there appears to be more mass present, at least on the 100h-1kpc scales probed, than predicted by simple ΛCDM biasing prescriptions, and thus constrain halo occupation models of the galaxy distribution.},

title = {Scale-dependent halo bias from scale-dependent growth},
abstract = {We derive a general expression for the large-scale halo bias, in theories with a scale-dependent linear growth, using the excursion set formalism. Such theories include modified gravity models, and models in which the dark energy clustering is non-negligible. A scale dependence is imprinted in both the formation and evolved biases by the scale-dependent growth. Mergers are accounted for in our derivation, which thus extends earlier work which focused on passive evolution. There is a simple analytic form for the bias for those theories in which the nonlinear collapse of perturbations is approximately the same as in general relativity. As an illustration, we apply our results to a simple Yukawa modification of gravity, and use SDSS measurements of the clustering of luminous red galaxies to constrain the theory's parameters.},

title = {Weak Lensing Mass Calibration with Shear and Magnification},
abstract = {We study how joint shear and magnification measurements improve the statistical precision of weak lensing mass calibration experiments, relative to standard shear-only analysis. For our magnification measurements, we consider not only the impact of lensing on the source density of galaxies, but also the apparent increase in source sizes. The combination of all three lensing probes - density, size, and shear - can improve the statistical precision of mass estimates by as much as 40% - 50%. This number is insensitive to survey assumptions, though it depends on the degree of knowledge of the parameters controlling the magnification measurements, and on the value of the parameter q that characterizes the response of the source population to magnification. Furthermore, the combination of magnification and shear allows for powerful cross-checks on residual systematics (such as point spread function corrections) at the few percent level.},

title = {The covariance of cosmic shear correlation functions and cosmological  parameter estimates using redshift information},
abstract = { Cosmological weak lensing by the large scale structure of the Universe, cosmic shear, is coming of age as a powerful probe of the parameters describing the cosmological model and matter power spectrum. It complements CMB studies, by breaking degeneracies and providing a cross-check. An important measure of the cosmic shear signal are the shear correlation functions; these can be directly calculated from data, and compared with theoretical expectations for different cosmological models and matter power spectra. We present a Monte Carlo method to quickly simulate mock cosmic shear surveys. One application of this method is in the determination of the full covariance matrix for the correlation functions; this includes redshift binning and is applicable to arbitrary survey geometries. Terms arising from shot noise and cosmic variance (dominant on small and large scales respectively) are accounted for naturally. As an illustration of the use of such covariance matrices, we consider to what degree confidence regions on parameters are tightened when redshift binning is employed. The parameters considered are those commonly discussed in cosmic shear analyses - the matter density parameter, dark energy density parameter (classical cosmological constant), power spectrum normalisation and shape parameter. We incorporate our covariance matrices into a likelihood treatment, and also use the Fisher formalism to explore a larger region of parameter space (abridged). },

title = {Combining weak-lensing tomography and spectroscopic redshift surveys},
abstract = {Redshift space distortion (RSD) is a powerful way of measuring the growth of structure and testing General Relativity, but it is limited by cosmic variance and the degeneracy between the galaxy bias b and the growth rate factor f. The cross-correlation of lensing shear with the galaxy density field can in principle measure b in a manner free from cosmic variance limits, breaking the f - b degeneracy and allowing inference of the matter power spectrum from the galaxy survey. We analyse the growth constraints from a realistic tomographic weak-lensing photo-z survey combined with a spectroscopic galaxy redshift survey over the same sky area. For sky coverage fsky= 0.5, analysis of the transverse modes measures b to 2-3 per cent accuracy per Δz= 0.1 bin at z < 1 when ˜10 galaxies arcmin-2 are measured in the lensing survey and all haloes with M > Mmin= 1013 h-1 M⊙ have spectra. For the gravitational growth parameter parameter γ (?, combining the lensing information with RSD analysis of non-transverse modes yields accuracy σ(γ) ≈ 0.01. Adding lensing information to the RSD survey improves σ(γ) by an amount equivalent to a 3 × (10 ×) increase in the RSD survey area when the spectroscopic survey extends down to halo mass 1013.5 (1014) h-1 M⊙. We also find that the σ(γ) of overlapping surveys is equivalent to that of surveys 1.5-2× larger if they are separated on the sky. This gain is greatest when the spectroscopic mass threshold is 1013-1014 h-1 M⊙, similar to Luminous Red Galaxy surveys. The gain of overlapping surveys is reduced for very deep or very shallow spectroscopic surveys, but any practical surveys are more powerful when overlapped than when separated. The gain of overlapped surveys is larger in the case when the primordial power spectrum normalization is uncertain by >0.5 per cent.},

abstract = {Galaxy-galaxy lensing has emerged as a powerful probe of the dark matter haloes of galaxies, but is subject to contamination if intrinsically aligned satellites of the lens galaxy are used as part of the source sample. We present a measurement of this intrinsic shear using 200747 lens galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic sample and a sample of satellites selected using photometric redshifts. The mean intrinsic shear at transverse separations of 30-446 h-1 kpc is constrained to be -0.0062 < Δγ < +0.0066 (99.9 per cent confidence, including identified systematics), which limits contamination of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal to at most ~15 per cent on these scales. We present these limits as a function of transverse separation and lens luminosity. We furthermore investigate shear calibration biases in the SDSS, which can also affect galaxy-galaxy lensing, and conclude that the shear amplitude is calibrated to better than 18 per cent. This includes noise-induced calibration biases in the ellipticity, which are small for the sample considered here, but which can be more important if low signal-to-noise ratio or poorly resolved source galaxies are used.},

title = {Dissecting the Gravitational Lens B1608+656. II. Precision Measurements of the Hubble Constant, Spatial Curvature, and the Dark Energy Equation of State},
abstract = {Strong gravitational lens systems with measured time delays between the multiple images provide a method for measuring the "time-delay distance" to the lens, and thus the Hubble constant. We present a Bayesian analysis of the strong gravitational lens system B1608+656, incorporating (i) new, deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, (ii) a new velocity dispersion measurement of 260+/-15 km/s for the primary lens galaxy, and (iii) an updated study of the lens' environment. When modeling the stellar dynamics of the primary lens galaxy, the lensing effect, and the environment of the lens, we explicitly include the total mass distribution profile logarithmic slope gamma' and the external convergence kappa_ext; we marginalize over these parameters, assigning well-motivated priors for them, and so turn the major systematic errors into statistical ones. The HST images provide one such prior, constraining the lens mass density profile logarithmic slope to be gamma'=2.08+/-0.03; a combination of numerical simulations and photometric observations of the B1608+656 field provides an estimate of the prior for kappa_ext: 0.10 +0.08/-0.05. This latter distribution dominates the final uncertainty on H_0. Compared with previous work on this system, the new data provide an increase in precision of more than a factor of two. In combination with the WMAP 5-year data set, we find that the B1608+656 data set constrains the curvature parameter to be -0.031 < Omega_k < 0.009 (95% CL), a level of precision comparable to that afforded by the current Type Ia SNe sample. Asserting a flat spatial geometry, we find that, in combination with WMAP, H_0 = 69.7 +4.9/-5.0 km/s/Mpc and w=-0.94 +0.17/-0.19 (68% CL), suggesting that the observations of B1608+656 constrain w as tightly as do the current Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data.

abstract = {Euclid is a space-based survey mission from the European Space Agency designed to understand the origin of the Universe's accelerating expansion. It will use cosmological probes to investigate the nature of dark energy, dark matter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometry of the universe and on the cosmic history of structure formation. The mission is optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid payload consists of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field of view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of ~0.54 deg2: the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP) which contains a slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20 deg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric redshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) < 0.05. They are derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range 0.92-2.0 micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived from public data or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are determined from a spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless spectrometer, with spectral resolution ~250, predominantly detects Ha emission line galaxies. Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019. This report (also known as the Euclid Red Book) describes the outcome of the Phase A study.},

abstract = { We propose a new approach for measuring the mass profile and shape of groups and clusters of galaxies, which uses lensing magnification of distant background galaxies. The main advantage of lensing magnification is that, unlike lensing shear, it relies on accurate photometric redshifts only and not galaxy shapes, thus enabling the study of the dark matter distribution with unresolved source galaxies. We present a feasibility study, using a real population of z > 2.5 Lyman Break Galaxies as source galaxies, and where, similar to galaxy-galaxy lensing, foreground lenses are stacked in order to increase the signal-to-noise. We find that there is an interesting new observational window for gravitational lensing as a probe of dark matter halos at high redshift, which does not require measurement of galaxy shapes. },

title = {The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey: power-spectrum analysis of the final data set and cosmological implications},
abstract = {We present a power-spectrum analysis of the final 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), employing a direct Fourier method. The sample used comprises 221414 galaxies with measured redshifts. We investigate in detail the modelling of the sample selection, improving on previous treatments in a number of respects. A new angular mask is derived, based on revisions to the photometric calibration. The redshift selection function is determined by dividing the survey according to rest-frame colour, and deducing a self-consistent treatment of k-corrections and evolution for each population. The covariance matrix for the power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different approaches to the construction of mock surveys, which are used to demonstrate that the input cosmological model can be correctly recovered. We discuss in detail the possible differences between the galaxy and mass power spectra, and treat these using simulations, analytic models and a hybrid empirical approach. Based on these investigations, we are confident that the 2dFGRS power spectrum can be used to infer the matter content of the universe. On large scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence for the `baryon oscillations' that are predicted in cold dark matter (CDM) models. Fitting to a CDM model, assuming a primordial ns= 1 spectrum, h= 0.72 and negligible neutrino mass, the preferred parameters are Ωmh= 0.168 +/- 0.016 and a baryon fraction Ωb/Ωm= 0.185 +/- 0.046 (1σ errors). The value of Ωmh is 1σ lower than the 0.20 +/- 0.03 in our 2001 analysis of the partially complete 2dFGRS. This shift is largely due to the signal from the newly sampled regions of space, rather than the refinements in the treatment of observational selection. This analysis therefore implies a density significantly below the standard Ωm= 0.3: in combination with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), we infer Ωm= 0.231 +/- 0.021.},

title = {Prospects for constraining the shape of non-Gaussianity with the scale-dependent bias},
abstract = {We consider whether the non-Gaussian scale-dependent halo bias can be used not only to constrain the local form of non-Gaussianity but also to distinguish among different shapes. In particular, we ask whether it can constrain the behavior of the primordial three-point function in the squeezed limit where one of the momenta is much smaller than the other two. This is potentially interesting since the observation of a three-point function with a squeezed limit that does not go like the local nor equilateral templates would be a signal of non-trivial dynamics during inflation. To this end we use the quasi-single field inflation model of Chen and Wang as a representative two-parameter model, where one parameter governs the amplitude of non-Gaussianity and the other the shape. We also perform a model-independent analysis by parametrizing the scale-dependent bias as a power-law on large scales, where the power is to be constrained from observations. We find that proposed large-scale structure surveys (with characteristics similar to the dark energy task force stage IV surveys) have the potential to distinguish among the squeezed limit behavior of different bispectrum shapes for a wide range of fiducial model parameters. Thus the halo bias can help discriminate between different models of inflation.},

abstract = {Hamilton et al. have suggested an invaluable scaling formula which describes how the power spectra of density fluctuations evolve into the non-linear regime of hierarchical clustering. This paper presents an extension of their method to low-density universes and universes with non-zero cosmological constant. We pay particular attention to models with large negative spectral indices, and give a spectrum-dependent fitting formula which is of significantly improved accuracy by comparison with an earlier version of this work. The tendency of non-linear effects to increase power on small scales is stronger for spectra with more negative spectral indices, and for lower densities. However, for low-density models with a cosmological constant, the non-linear effects are less strong than for an open universe of the same Omega.},

abstract = {Context: Two-point correlation functions are used throughout cosmology as a measure for the statistics of random fields. When used in Bayesian parameter estimation, their likelihood function is usually replaced by a Gaussian approximation. However, this has been shown to be insufficient. Aims: For the case of Gaussian random fields, we search for an exact probability distribution of correlation functions, which could improve the accuracy of future data analyses. Methods: We use a fully analytic approach, first expanding the random field in its Fourier modes, and then calculating the characteristic function. Finally, we derive the probability distribution function using integration by residues. We use a numerical implementation of the full analytic formula to discuss the behaviour of this function. Results: We derive the univariate and bivariate probability distribution function of the correlation functions of a Gaussian random field, and outline how higher joint distributions could be calculated. We give the results in the form of mode expansions, but in one special case we also find a closed-form expression. We calculate the moments of the distribution and, in the univariate case, we discuss the Edgeworth expansion approximation. We also comment on the difficulties in a fast and exact numerical implementation of our results.},

abstract = {Observed angular positions and redshifts of large-scale structure tracers such as galaxies are affected by gravitational waves through volume distortion and magnification effects. Thus, a gravitational wave background can in principle be probed through clustering statistics of large-scale structure. We calculate the observed angular clustering of galaxies in the presence of a gravitational wave background at linear order including all relativistic effects. For a scale-invariant spectrum of gravitational waves, the effects are most significant at the smallest multipoles (2 <= l <= 5), but typically suppressed by six or more orders of magnitude with respect to scalar contributions for currently allowed amplitudes of the inflationary gravitational wave background. We also discuss the most relevant second-order terms, corresponding to the distortion of tracer correlation functions by gravitational waves. These provide a natural application of the approach recently developed in arXiv:1204.3625.},

title = {Probing dark energy with the shear-ratio geometric test},
abstract = {We adapt the Jain-Taylor (2003) shear-ratio geometric lensing method to measure the dark energy equation of state, w = pv/ρv and its time derivative from dark matter haloes in cosmologies with arbitrary spatial curvature. The full shear-ratio covariance matrix is calculated for lensed sources, including the intervening large-scale structure and photometric redshift errors as additional sources of noise, and a maximum likelihood method for applying the test is presented. Decomposing the lensing matter distribution into dark matter haloes we calculate the parameter covariance matrix for an arbitrary experiment. Combining with the expected results from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) we design an optimal survey for probing dark energy. This shows that a targeted survey imaging 60 of the largest clusters in a hemisphere with five-band optical photometric redshifts to a median galaxy depth of zm = 0.9 could measure w0 ≡ w(z = 0) to a marginal 1σ error of Δw0 = 0.5. We marginalize over all other parameters including wa, where the equation of state is parametrized in terms of scalefactor a as w(a) = w0 + wa(1 - a). For higher accuracy a large-scale photometric redshift survey is required, where the largest gain in signal arises from the numerous ~1014Msolar haloes corresponding to medium-sized galaxy clusters. Combined with the expected Planck Surveyor results, such a near-future five-band survey covering 10000 deg2 to zm = 0.7 could measure w0 to Δw0 = 0.075 and Δwa = 0.33. A stronger combined constraint is put on w measured at the pivot redshift zp = 0.27 of Δw(zp) = 0.0298. We compare and combine the geometric test with the cosmological and dark energy parameters measured from planned baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and supernova Type Ia experiments, and find that the geometric test results combine with a significant reduction in errors due to different degeneracies. A combination of geometric lensing, CMB and BAO experiments could achieve Δw0 = 0.047 and Δwa = 0.111 with a pivot redshift constraint of Δw(zp) = 0.020 at zp = 0.62. Simple relations are presented that show how our lensing results can be scaled to other telescope classes and survey parameters.},

title = {Lensing by galaxies in CNOC2 fields},
abstract = {We have observed two blank fields of approximately 30 × 23 arcmin2 using the William Herschel Telescope. The fields have been studied as part of the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (CNOC2), and spectroscopic redshifts are available for 1125 galaxies in the two fields. We measured the lensing signal caused by large-scale structure, and found that the result is consistent with current, more accurate measurements. We study the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal of three overlapping samples of lenses (one with and two without redshift information), and detect a significant signal in all cases. The estimates for the velocity dispersion of an galaxy agree well for the various samples. The best-fitting singular isothermal sphere model to the ensemble-averaged tangential distortion around the galaxies with redshifts yields a velocity dispersion of σ*= 130+15-17 km s-1, or a circular velocity of V*c= 184+22-25 km s-1 for an L*B galaxy, in good agreement with other studies. We use a maximum-likelihood analysis, where a parametrized mass model is compared with the data, to study the extent of galaxy dark matter haloes. Making use of all available data, we find σ*= 111 +/- 12 km s-1 (68.3 per cent confidence, marginalized over the truncation parameter s) for a truncated isothermal sphere model in which all galaxies have the same mass-to-light ratio. The value of the truncation parameter s is not constrained that well, and we find s*= 260+124-73h-1 kpc (68.3 per cent confidence, marginalized over σ*), with a 99.7 per cent confidence lower limit of 80 h-1 kpc. Interestingly, our results provide a 95 per cent confidence upper limit of 556 h-1 kpc. The galaxy-galaxy lensing analysis allows us to estimate the average mass-to-light ratio of the field, which can be used to estimate Ωm. The current result, however, depends strongly on the assumed scaling relation for s.},

title = {Measuring dark energy properties with 3D cosmic shear},
abstract = {We present parameter estimation forecasts for present and future 3D cosmic shear surveys. We demonstrate in particular that, in conjunction with results from cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, the properties of dark energy can be estimated with very high precision with large-scale, fully 3D weak-lensing surveys. In particular, a five-band, 10000-deg2 ground-based survey of galaxies to a median redshift of zm = 0.7 could achieve 1σ marginal statistical errors, in combination with the constraints expected from the CMB Planck Surveyor, of Δw0 = 0.108 and Δwa = 0.099. We parametrize the redshift evolution of w by w(a) = w0 + wa(1 - a) where a is the scalefactor. Such a survey is achievable with a wide-field camera on a 4-m class telescope. The error on the value of w at an intermediate pivot redshift of z = 0.368 is constrained to Δw(z = 0.368) = 0.0175. We compare and combine the 3D weak-lensing constraints with the cosmological and dark energy parameters measured from planned baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and supernova Type Ia experiments, and find that 3D weak lensing significantly improves the marginalized errors on w0 and wa in combination, and provides constraints on w(z) at a unique redshift through the lensing effect. A combination of 3D weak-lensing, CMB and BAO experiments could achieve Δw0 = 0.037 and Δwa = 0.099. We also show how our results can be scaled to other telescopes and survey designs. Fully 3D weak shear analysis avoids the loss of information inherent in tomographic binning, and we also show that the sensitivity to systematic errors in photometric redshift is much less. In conjunction with the fact that the physics of lensing is very soundly based, the analysis here demonstrates that deep, wide-angle 3D weak-lensing surveys are extremely promising for measuring dark energy properties.},

title = {Improving measurements of H(z) and Da(z) by analyzing clustering anisotropies},
abstract = {The baryonic acoustic feature in galaxy clustering is a promising tool for constraining the nature of the cosmic acceleration, through measurements of expansion rates H and angular diameter distances D_A. Angle-averaged measurements of clustering yield constraints on the quantity D_A^2/H. However, to break the degeneracy between these two parameters one must measure the anisotropic correlation function as a function of both line-of-sight (radial) and transverse separations. Here we investigate how to most effectively do so, using analytic techniques and mock catalogues. In particular, we examine multipole expansions of the correlation function as well as "clustering wedges" xi(Delta mu, s), where mu = s_||/s and s_|| is the radial component of separation s. Both techniques allow strong constraints on H and D_A, as expected. The radial wedges strongly depend on H and the transverse wedges are sensitive to D_A. Analyses around the region of the acoustic peak constrain H ~20% better when using the wedge statistics than when using the monopole-quadrupole combination. However, we show that the hexadecapole allows substantially stronger constraints than the monopole and quadrupole alone. Our findings here demonstrate that wedge statistics provide a practical alternative technique to multipoles, that should be useful to test systematics and will provide comparable or better constraints. Finally, we predict the constraints from galaxy clustering that will be possible with a completed version of the ongoing Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey.},

title = {The effects of galaxy formation on the matter power spectrum: A challenge for precision cosmology},
abstract = {Upcoming weak lensing surveys, such as LSST, EUCLID, and WFIRST, aim to measure the matter power spectrum with unprecedented accuracy. In order to fully exploit these observations, models are needed that, given a set of cosmological parameters, can predict the non-linear matter power spectrum at the level of 1% or better for scales corresponding to comoving wave numbers 0.1<k<10 h/Mpc. We have employed the large suite of simulations from the OWLS project to investigate the effects of various baryonic processes on the matter power spectrum. In addition, we have examined the distribution of power over different mass components, the back-reaction of the baryons on the CDM, and the evolution of the dominant effects on the matter power spectrum. We find that single baryonic processes are capable of changing the power spectrum by up to several tens of per cent. Our simulation that includes AGN feedback, which we consider to be our most realistic simulation as, unlike those used in previous studies, it has been shown to solve the overcooling problem and to reproduce optical and X-ray observations of groups of galaxies, predicts a decrease in power relative to a dark matter only simulation ranging, at z=0, from 1% at k~0.3 h/Mpc to 10% at k~1 h/Mpc and to 30% at k~10 h/Mpc. This contradicts the naive view that baryons raise the power through cooling, which is the dominant effect only for k>70 h/Mpc. Therefore, baryons, and particularly AGN feedback, cannot be ignored in theoretical power spectra for k>0.3 h/Mpc. It will thus be necessary to improve our understanding of feedback processes in galaxy formation, or at least to constrain them through auxiliary observations, before we can fulfil the goals of upcoming weak lensing surveys.},

title = {Cosmological information in Gaussianised weak lensing signals},
abstract = {We investigate the information on cosmology contained in Gaussianised weak gravitational lensing convergence fields. Employing Box-Cox transformations to determine optimal transformations to Gaussianity, we develop analytical models for the transformed power spectrum, including effects of noise and smoothing. We find that optimised Box-Cox transformations perform substantially better than an offset logarithmic transformation in Gaussianising the convergence, but both yield very similar results for the signal-to-noise and parameter constraints. None of the transformations is capable of eliminating correlations of the power spectra between different angular frequencies, which we demonstrate to have a significant impact on the errors on cosmology. The performance of the analytical models is limited by the uncertainty in higher-order correlations of the original convergence and the form of the convergence bispectrum in the non-linear regime, producing biased parameter estimates. In the idealistic case, without galaxy shape noise, we find an increase in cumulative signal-to-noise by a factor of 2.6 for angular frequencies up to 1500, and a decrease in the area of the confidence region in the Omega_m-sigma_8 plane by a factor of 5.5 in terms of q-values for the best-performing transformation. When adding a realistic level of shape noise, all transformations perform poorly with little decorrelation of angular frequencies, a maximum increase in signal-to-noise of 34%, and even marginally degraded errors on cosmological parameters. We argue that, to find Gaussianising transformations of practical use, one will need to go beyond transformations of the one-point distribution of the convergence, extend the analysis deeper into the non-linear regime, and resort to an exploration of parameter space via simulations.

title = {Weak Lensing and Cosmology},
abstract = {We explore the dependence of weak lensing phenomena on the background cosmology. We first generalize the relation between P psi ( omega ), the angular power spectrum of the distortion, and the power spectrum of density fluctuations to nonflat cosmologies. We then compute P psi for various illustrative models. A useful cosmological discriminator is the growth of P psi with source redshift, which is much stronger in low-matter density models and especially in Lamda -dominated models. With even crude redshift information (say from broadband colors), it should be possible to constrain the cosmological world model. The amplitude of P psi ( omega ) is also quite sensitive to the cosmology, but requires a reliable external normalization for the mass fluctuations. If one normalizes to galaxy clustering, with M/L fixed by small-scale galaxy dynamics, then low-density models predict a much stronger distortion. If, however, one normalizes to large-scale bulk flows, the predicted distortion for sources at redshifts Zs ~ 1-3 is rather insensitive to the background cosmology. The signals predicted here can be detected at a very high level of significance with a photometric survey covering, say, 10 deg2, but sparse sampling is needed to avoid large sampling variance. We discuss the factors influencing the design of an optimum survey. Turning to weak lensing by clusters, we find that for high lens redshifts (Zl ~= 1) the critical density is substantially reduced in Lamda -models, but that the ratio of the shear or convergence to the velocity dispersions or X-ray temperature of clusters is only very weakly dependent on the cosmology.},

title = {The cosmic history of the spin of dark matter haloes within the large scale structure},
abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the evolution of the orientation and magnitude of dark matter halo angular momentum within the large scale structure since z=3. We look at the evolution of the alignment of halo spins with filaments and with each other, as well as the spin parameter, which is a measure of the magnitude of angular momentum. It was found that the angular momentum vectors of dark matter haloes at high redshift have a weak tendency to be orthogonal to filaments and high mass haloes have a stronger orthogonal alignment than low mass haloes. Since z=1, the spins of low mass haloes have become weakly aligned parallel to filaments, whereas high mass haloes keep their orthogonal alignment. This recent parallel alignment of low mass haloes casts doubt on tidal torque theory as the sole mechanism for the build up of angular momentum. We find a significant alignment of neighboring dark matter haloes only at very small separations, r<0.3Mpc/h, which is driven by substructure. A correlation of the spin parameter with halo mass is confirmed at high redshift.},

title = {Connecting the cosmic web to the spin of dark halos: implications for galaxy formation},
abstract = {We investigate the alignment of the spin of dark matter halos relative (i) to the surrounding large-scale filamentary structure, and (ii) to the tidal tensor eigenvectors using the Horizon 4pi dark matter simulation which resolves over 43 million dark matter halos at redshift zero. We detect a clear mass transition: the spin of dark matter halos above a critical mass tends to be perpendicular to the closest filament, and aligned with the intermediate axis of the tidal tensor, whereas the spin of low-mass halos is more likely to be aligned with the closest filament. Furthermore, this critical mass of 5 10^12 is redshift-dependent and scales as (1+z)^-2.5. We propose an interpretation of this signal in terms of large-scale cosmic flows. In this picture, most low-mass halos are formed through the winding of flows embedded in misaligned walls; hence they acquire a spin parallel to the axis of the resulting filaments forming at the intersection of these walls. On the other hand, more massive halos are typically the products of later mergers along such filaments, and thus they acquire a spin perpendicular to this direction when their orbital angular momentum is converted into spin. We show that this scenario is consistent with both the measured excess probabilities of alignment w.r.t. the eigen-directions of the tidal tensor, and halo merger histories. On a more qualitative level, it also seems compatible with 3D visualization of the structure of the cosmic web as traced by "smoothed" dark matter simulations or gas tracer particles. Finally, it provides extra support to the disc forming paradigm presented by Pichon et al (2011) as it extends it by characterizing the geometry of secondary infall at high redshift.},

title = {Weak lensing reconstruction through cosmic magnification. II. Improved power spectrum determination and map-making},
abstract = {The existence of galaxy intrinsic clustering severely hampers the weak lensing reconstruction from cosmic magnification. In paper I \citep{Yang2011}, we proposed a minimal variance estimator to overcome this problem. By utilizing the different dependences of cosmic magnification and galaxy intrinsic clustering on galaxy flux, we demonstrated that the otherwise overwhelming galaxy intrinsic clustering can be significantly suppressed such that lensing maps can be reconstructed with promising accuracy. This procedure relies heavily on the accuracy of determining the galaxy bias from the same data. Paper I adopts an iterative approach, which degrades toward high redshift. The current paper presents an alternative method, improving over paper I. We prove that the measured galaxy clustering between flux bins allows for simultaneous determination of the lensing power spectrum and the flux dependence of galaxy bias, at this redshift bin. Comparing to paper I, the new approach is not only more straightforward, but also more robust. It identifies an ambiguity in determining the galaxy bias and further discovers a mathematically robust way to suppress this ambiguity to non-negligible level ({\$}\sim 0.1%{\$}). The accurately determined galaxy bias can then be applied to the minimal variance estimator proposed in paper I to improve the lensing map-making. The gain at high redshift is significant. These maps can be used to measure other statistics, such as cluster finding and peak statistics. Furthermore, by including galaxy clustering measurement between different redshift bins, we can also determine the lensing cross power spectrum between these bins, up to a small and correctable multiplicative factor.},

title = {Simultaneous measurement of cosmology and intrinsic alignments using joint cosmic shear and galaxy number density correlations},
abstract = {Aims: Cosmic shear is a powerful method to constrain cosmology, provided that any systematic effects are under control. The intrinsic alignment of galaxies is expected to severely bias parameter estimates if not taken into account. We explore the potential of a joint analysis of tomographic galaxy ellipticity, galaxy number density, and ellipticity-number density cross-correlations to simultaneously constrain cosmology and self-calibrate unknown intrinsic alignment and galaxy bias contributions. Methods: We treat intrinsic alignments and galaxy biasing as free functions of scale and redshift and marginalise over the resulting parameter sets. Constraints on cosmology are calculated by combining the likelihoods from all two-point correlations between galaxy ellipticity and galaxy number density. The information required for these calculations is already available in a standard cosmic shear data set. We include contributions to these functions from cosmic shear, intrinsic alignments, galaxy clustering and magnification effects. Results: In a Fisher matrix analysis we compare our constraints with those from cosmic shear alone in the absence of intrinsic alignments. For a potential future large area survey, such as Euclid, the extra information from the additional correlation functions can make up for the additional free parameters in the intrinsic alignment and galaxy bias terms, depending on the flexibility in the models. For example, the dark energy task force figure of merit is recovered even when more than 100 free parameters are marginalised over. We find that the redshift quality requirements are similar to those calculated in the absence of intrinsic alignments.},

title = {Analysis of two-point statistics of cosmic shear. I. Estimators and covariances},
abstract = {Recently, cosmic shear, the weak lensing effect by the inhomogeneous matter distribution in the Universe, has not only been detected by several groups, but the observational results have been used to derive constraints on cosmological parameters. For this purpose, several cosmic shear statistics have been employed. As shown recently, all second-order statistical measures can be expressed in terms of the two-point correlation functions of the shear, which thus represents the basic quantity; also, from a practical point-of-view, the two-point correlation functions are easiest to obtain from observational data which typically have complicated geometry. We derive in this paper expressions for the covariance matrix of the cosmic shear two-point correlation functions which are readily applied to any survey geometry. Furthermore, we consider the more special case of a simple survey geometry which allows us to obtain approximations for the covariance matrix in terms of integrals which are readily evaluated numerically. These results are then used to study the covariance of the aperture mass dispersion which has been employed earlier in quantitative cosmic shear analyses. We show that the aperture mass dispersion, measured at two different angular scales, quickly decorrelates with the ratio of the scales. Inverting the relation between the shear two-point correlation functions and the power spectrum of the underlying projected matter distribution, we construct estimators for the power spectrum and for the band powers, and show that they yields accurate approximations; in particular, the correlation between band powers at different wave numbers is quite weak. The covariance matrix of the shear correlation function is then used to investigate the expected accuracy of cosmological parameter estimates from cosmic shear surveys. Depending on the use of prior information, e.g. from CMB measurements, cosmic shear can yield very accurate determinations of several cosmological parameters, in particular the normalization sigma_8 of the power spectrum of the matter distribution, the matter density parameter {cal O}mega_m, and the shape parameter Gamma .},

title = {Intrinsic galaxy alignments from the 2SLAQ and SDSS surveys: luminosity and redshift scalings and implications for weak lensing surveys},
abstract = {Correlations between intrinsic shear and the density field on large scales, a potentially important contaminant for cosmic shear surveys, have been robustly detected at low redshifts with bright galaxies in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. Here we present a more detailed characterization of this effect, which can cause anticorrelations between gravitational lensing shear and intrinsic ellipticity (GI correlations). This measurement uses 36278 luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the SDSS spectroscopic sample with 0.15 < z < 0.35, split by redshift and luminosity; 7758 LRGs from the 2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO (2SLAQ) survey at 0.4 < z < 0.8; and a variety of other SDSS samples from previous, related work. We find >3σ detections of the effect on large scales (up to 60h-1Mpc) for all galaxy subsamples within the SDSS LRG sample; for the 2SLAQ sample, we find a 2σ detection for a bright subsample, and no detection for a fainter subsample. Fitting formulae are provided for the scaling of the GI correlations with luminosity, transverse separation and redshift (for which the 2SLAQ sample, while small, provides crucial constraints due to its longer baseline in redshift). We estimate contamination in the measurement of σ8 for future cosmic shear surveys on the basis of the fitted dependence of GI correlations on galaxy properties. We find contamination to the power spectrum ranging from -1.5 per cent (optimistic) to -33 per cent (pessimistic) for a toy cosmic shear survey using all galaxies to a depth of R = 24 using scales l ~ 500, though the central value of predicted contamination is -6.5 per cent. This corresponds to a bias in σ8 of Δσ8 = -0.004 (optimistic), -0.02 (central) or -0.10 (pessimistic). We provide a prescription for inclusion of this error in cosmological parameter estimation codes. The principal uncertainty is in the treatment of the L <= L* blue galaxies, for which we have no detection of the GI signal, but which could dominate the GI contamination if their GI amplitude is near our upper limits. Characterization of the tidal alignments of these galaxies, especially at redshifts relevant for cosmic shear, should be a high priority for the cosmic shear community.},

title = {Measuring primordial non-Gaussianity with weak-lensing surveys},
abstract = {We study the ability of future weak lensing (WL) surveys to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type. We use a large ensemble of simulated WL maps with survey specifications relevant to Euclid and LSST. The simulations assume Cold Dark Matter cosmologies that vary certain parameters around fiducial values: the non-Gaussianity parameter f_NL, the matter density parameter Omega_m, the amplitude of the matter power spectrum sigma_8, the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum n_s, and the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter w_0. We assess the sensitivity of the cosmic shear correlation functions, the third-order aperture mass statistics, and the abundance of shear peaks to these parameters. We find that each of the considered probes provides unmarginalized constraints of Delta f_NL ~ 20 on f_NL. Marginalized constraints from any individual WL probe are much weaker due to strong correlations between parameters. However, the parameter errors can be substantially reduced by combining information from different WL probes. Combining all WL probes yields the following marginal (68% confidence level) uncertainties: Delta f_NL ~ 50, Delta Omega_m ~ 0.002, Delta sigma_8 ~ 0.004, Delta n_s ~ 0.007, and Delta w_0 ~ 0.03. We examine the bias induced by neglecting f_NL on the constraints on the other parameters. We find sigma_8 and w_0 to be the most affected. Moreover, neglecting non-Gaussianity leads to a severe underestimation of the uncertainties in the other cosmological parameters.},

title = {Shear and magnification angular power spectra and higher-order moments from weak gravitational lensing},
abstract = {We present new results on the gravitational lensing shear and magnification power spectra obtained from numerical simulations of a flat cosmology with a cosmological constant. These results are of considerable interest since both the shear and the magnification are observables. We find that the power spectrum in the convergence behaves as expected, but the magnification develops a shot-noise spectrum due to the effects of discrete, massive clusters and symptomatic of moderate lensing beyond the weak-lensing regime. We find that this behaviour can be suppressed by "clipping" of the largest projected clusters. Our results are compared with predictions from a Halo Model-inspired functional fit for the non-linear evolution of the matter field and show excellent agreement. We also study the higher-order moments of the convergence field and find a new scaling relationship with redshift. In particular, the statistic {\$}S_3{\$} is found to vary as {\$}z_s^{-2.00\pm 0.08}{\$} (where {\$}z_s{\$} is the source redshift) for the cosmology studied, which makes corrections for different median redshifts in different observational surveys particularly simple to apply.},

title = {Improved constraints on the expansion rate of the Universe up to z~1.1 from the spectroscopic evolution of cosmic chronometers},
abstract = {We present new improved constraints on the Hubble parameter H(z) in the redshift range 0.15 < z < 1.1, obtained from the differential spectroscopic evolution of early-type galaxies as a function of redshift. We extract a large sample of early-type galaxies (~11000) from several spectroscopic surveys, spanning almost 8 billion years of cosmic lookback time (0.15 < z < 1.42). We select the most massive, red elliptical galaxies, passively evolving and without signature of ongoing star formation. Those galaxies can be used as standard cosmic chronometers, whose differential age evolution as a function of cosmic time directly probes H(z). We analyze the 4000 {\AA} break (D4000) as a function of redshift, use stellar population synthesis models to theoretically calibrate the dependence of the differential age evolution on the differential D4000, and estimate the Hubble parameter taking into account both statistical and systematical errors. We provide 8 new measurements of H(z), and determine its change in H(z) to a precision of 5-12% mapping homogeneously the redshift range up to z~1.1; for the first time, we place a constraint on H(z) at z \neq 0 with a precision comparable with the one achieved for the Hubble constant (about 5-6% at z~0.2), and covered a redshift range (0.5 < z < 0.8) which is crucial to distinguish many different quintessence cosmologies. These measurements have been tested to best match a \Lambda CDM model, clearly providing a statistically robust indication that the Universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion. This method shows the potentiality to open a new avenue in constrain a variety of alternative cosmologies, especially when future surveys (e.g. Euclid) will open the possibility to extend it up to z~2.},

Studying these correlations is important both to improve our understanding of galaxy properties and because it is an important potential systematic for weak lensing magnification measurements. Our model assumes that the density field drives these intrinsic correlations and we also model the distribution of satellite galaxies. We calculate the possible contamination to measurements of lensing convergence power spectrum from galaxy sizes, and show that the cross-correlation of intrinsic sizes with convergence is potentially an important systematic. We also explore how these intrinsic size correlations may affect surveys with different redshift depth. We find that, in this simple approach, intrinsic size correlations cannot be neglected in order to estimate lensing convergence power spectrum for constraining cosmological parameters.},

abstract = {Current measurements of the low and high redshift Universe are in tension if we restrict ourselves to the standard six parameter model of flat {\$}\Lambda{\$}CDM. This tension has two parts. First, the Planck satellite data suggest a higher normalization of matter perturbations than local measurements of galaxy clusters. Second, the expansion rate of the Universe today, {\$}H_0{\$}, derived from local distance-redshift measurements is significantly higher than that inferred using the acoustic scale in galaxy surveys and the Planck data as a standard ruler. The addition of a sterile neutrino species changes the acoustic scale and brings the two into agreement; meanwhile, adding mass to the active neutrinos or to a sterile neutrino can suppress the growth of structure, bringing the cluster data into better concordance as well. For our fiducial dataset combination, with statistical errors for clusters, a model with a massive sterile neutrino shows 3.5{\$}\sigma{\$} evidence for a non-zero mass and an even stronger rejection of the minimal model. A model with massive active neutrinos and a massless sterile neutrino is similarly preferred. An eV-scale sterile neutrino mass - of interest for short baseline and reactor anomalies - is well within the allowed range. We caution that 1) unknown astrophysical systematic errors in any of the data sets could weaken this conclusion, but they would need to be several times the known errors to eliminate the tensions entirely; 2) the results we find are at some variance with analyses that do not include cluster measurements; and 3) some tension remains among the datasets even when new neutrino physics is included.},

title = {Weak Gravitational Lensing by Galaxies},
abstract = {We report a detection of weak, tangential distortion of the images of cosmologically distant, faint galaxies due to gravitational lensing by foreground galaxies. A mean image polarization of (p)= 0.011 +/- 0.006 (95% confidence bounds) is obtained for 3202 pairs of source (23 < r_s_ <24) and lens (20 (20 <= r_d_ <= 23) galaxies with projected separations of 5" <= θ <= 34". Averaged over annuli of inner radIus 5" and outer radius θ_max_, the signal is string for lens-source separations of θ_max_ <~ 90" consistent with quas-isothermal galaxy halos extending to large radii (~>100 h^-1^ kpc). The observed polarization is also consistent with the signal expected on the basis of simulations incorporating measured properties of local galaxies and modest extrapolations of the observed redshift distribution of faint galaxies (to which the results are somewhat sensitive). From the simulations we obtain formal best-fit model parameters for the dark halos of the lens galaxies that consist of a characteristic circular velocity of V^*^ ~220 +/- 80 km s^-1^ and characteristic radial extent of s^*^ ~> 100 h^-1^ kpc. The predicted polarization based on the model is relatively insensitive to the characteristic radial extent of the halos, s^*^, and very small halos (s^*^ ~ 10 h^-1^ kpc) are excluded only at the 2 a level. The formal best-fit halo parameters imply typical masses for the lens galaxies within a radius of 100 h^-1^ kpc on the order of 1.0_-0.5_^+1.2^ x 10^12^ h^-1^ M_sun_ (90% confidence bounds), in agreement with recent dynamical estimates of the masses of local spiral galaxies. This is particularly encouraging as the lensing and dynamical mass estimators rely on different sets of assumptions. Contamination of the gravitational lensing signal by a population of tidally distorted satellite galaxies can be ruled out with reasonable confidence. The prospects for corroborating and improving this measurement seem good, especially using deep HST archival data.},

title = {Galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing: a promising union to constrain cosmological parameters},
abstract = {Galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing probe the connection between galaxies and their dark matter haloes in complementary ways. Since the clustering of dark matter haloes depends on cosmology, the halo occupation statistics inferred from the observed clustering properties of galaxies are degenerate with the adopted cosmology. Consequently, different cosmologies imply different mass-to-light ratios for dark matter haloes. Galaxy-galaxy lensing, which yields direct constraints on the actual mass-to-light ratios, can therefore be used to break this degeneracy, and thus to constrain cosmological parameters. In this paper, we establish the link between galaxy luminosity and dark matter halo mass using the conditional luminosity function (CLF), Φ(L|M)dL, which gives the number of galaxies with luminosities in the range L +/- dL/2 that reside in a halo of mass M. We constrain the CLF parameters using the galaxy luminosity function and the luminosity dependence of the correlation lengths of galaxies. The resulting CLF models are used to predict the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal. For a cosmology that agrees with constraints from the cosmic microwave background, i.e. (Ωm,σ8) = (0.238,0.734), the model accurately fits the galaxy-galaxy lensing data obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For a comparison cosmology with (Ωm,σ8) = (0.3,0.9), however, we can accurately fit the luminosity function and clustering properties of the galaxy population, but the model predicts mass-to-light ratios that are too high, resulting in a strong overprediction of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal. We conclude that the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing is a powerful probe of the galaxy-dark matter connection, with the potential to yield tight constraints on cosmological parameters. Since this method mainly probes the mass distribution on relatively small (non-linear) scales, it is complementary to constraints obtained from the galaxy power spectrum, which mainly probes the large-scale (linear) matter distribution.},

We describe in detail how we construct the survey selection function allowing for the varying target completeness and redshift completeness. We measure the total power with an accuracy of approximately 5 per cent in wavenumber bands of Δk = 0.01h Mpc-1. A model power spectrum including non-linear corrections, combined with a linear galaxy bias factor and a simple model for redshift-space distortions, provides a good fit to our data for scales k < 0.4h Mpc-1. The large-scale shape of the power spectrum is consistent with the best-fitting matter and baryon densities determined by observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. By splitting the power spectrum measurement as a function of tangential and radial wavenumbers, we delineate the characteristic imprint of peculiar velocities. We use these to determine the growth rate of structure as a function of redshift in the range 0.4 < z < 0.8, including a data point at z = 0.78 with an accuracy of 20 per cent. Our growth rate measurements are a close match to the self-consistent prediction of the Λ cold dark matter model. The WiggleZ survey data will allow a wide range of investigations into the cosmological model, cosmic expansion and growth history, topology of cosmic structure and Gaussianity of the initial conditions. Our calculation of the survey selection function will be released at a future date via our website wigglez.swin.edu.au.},

They are based upon a physically well-motivated separation of the effects of acoustic oscillations, Compton drag, velocity overshoot, baryon infall, adiabatic damping, Silk damping, and cold dark matter growth suppression. We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better motivated form for the zero-baryon transfer function than previous works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction Omega b/ Omega 0 >~ Omega 0h2 + 0.2, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon. We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter Gamma .},

abstract = {We examine scatter and bias in weak lensing selected clusters, employing both analytic models of dark matter haloes and numerical mock data of weak lensing cluster surveys. We pay special attention to effects of the diversity of dark matter distributions within clusters. We examine the dependence of the halo shape on the peak heights, and find that the root-mean-square scatter caused by the halo diversity scales linearly with the peak heights with the proportionality factor of 0.1-0.2. The noise originates from the halo shape is found to be comparable to the source galaxy shape noise and the cosmic shear noise. We find the significant halo orientation bias, i.e., weak lensing selected clusters on average have their major axes aligned with the line-of-sight direction, and that the orientation bias is stronger for higher signal-to-noise ratio peaks. We compute the orientation bias using an analytic triaxial halo model and obtain results quite consistent with the ray-tracing results. We develop a prescription to analytically compute the number count of weak lensing peaks taking into account all the main sources of scatters in peak heights. We find that the improved analytic predictions agree well with the simulation results for high peaks of SN>5. We also compare the expected number count with our weak lensing analysis results for 4 sq deg of Subaru/Suprime-cam observations and find a good agreement.},

abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing observations probe the spectrum and evolution of density fluctuations and the cosmological parameters which govern them but are currently limited to small fields and subject to selection biases. We show how the expected signal from large-scale structure arises from the contributions from and correlations between individual halos. We determine the convergence power spectrum as a function of the maximum halo mass and so provide the means to interpret results from surveys that lack high mass halos either through selection criteria or small fields. Since shot noise from rare massive halos is mainly responsible for the sample variance below 10', our method should aid our ability to extract cosmological information from small fields.},

title = {Halo occupation numbers and galaxy bias},
abstract = {We propose a heuristic model that displays the main features of realistic theories for galaxy bias. We show that the low-order clustering statistics of the dark-matter distribution depend almost entirely on the locations and density profiles of dark-matter haloes. A hypothetical galaxy catalogue depends on (i) the efficiency of galaxy formation, as manifested by the halo occupation number - the number of galaxies brighter than some sample limit contained in a halo of a given mass; (ii) the location of these galaxies within their halo. The first factor is constrained by the empirical luminosity function of groups. For the second factor, we assume that one galaxy marks the halo centre, with any remaining galaxies acting as satellites that trace the halo mass. These simple assumptions amount to a recipe for non-local bias, in which the probability of finding a galaxy is not a simple function of its local mass density. We have applied this prescription to some CDM models of current interest, and find that the predictions are close to the observed galaxy correlations for a flat {\$}{\O}mega=0.3{\$} model ({\$}\Lambda{\$}CDM), but not for an {\$}{\O}mega=1{\$} model with the same power spectrum ({\$}\tau{\$}CDM). This is an inevitable consequence of cluster normalization for the power spectra: cluster-scale haloes of given mass have smaller core radii for high {\$}{\O}mega{\$}, and hence display enhanced small-scale clustering. Finally, the pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies in the {\$}\Lambda{\$}CDM model is lower than that of the mass, allowing cluster-normalized models to yield a realistic Mach number for the peculiar velocity field. This is largely due to the strong variation of galaxy-formation efficiency with halo mass that is required in this model.},

title = {A strategy for finding gravitationally lensed distant supernovae},
abstract = {Distant Type Ia and II supernovae (SNe) can serve as valuable probes of the history of the cosmic expansion and star formation, and provide important information on their progenitor models. At present, however, there are few observational constraints on the abundance of SNe at high redshifts. A major science driver for the Next Generation Space Telescope is the study of such very distant SNe. In this paper we discuss strategies for finding and counting distant SNe by using repeat imaging of supercritical intermediate redshift clusters whose mass distributions are well constrained via modelling of strongly lensed features. For a variety of different models for the star formation history and supernova progenitors, we estimate the likelihood of detecting lensed SNe as a function of their redshift. In the case of a survey conducted with Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we predict a high probability of seeing a supernova in a single return visit with either Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 or Advanced Camera for Surveys, and a much higher probability of detecting examples with ρ(r) = (σν2)/(2πGr2), z>1 in the lensed case. Most events would represent magnified SNe II at M(r) = (2σν2)/G, z~=1, and a fraction will be more distant examples. We discuss various ways to classify such events using ground-based infrared photometry. We demonstrate an application of the method using the HST archival data and discuss the case of a possible event found in the rich cluster AC114 ρ(r) = [(ρcδc)/(rrs)(1 + rrs)2, (z=0.31).},

title = {Two Accurate Time-delay Distances from Strong Lensing: Implications for Cosmology},
abstract = {Strong gravitational lenses with measured time delays between the multiple images and models of the lens mass distribution allow a one-step determination of the time-delay distance, and thus a measure of cosmological parameters. We present a blind analysis of the gravitational lens RXJ1131-1231 incorporating (1) the newly measured time delays from COSMOGRAIL, the COSmological MOnitoring of GRAvItational Lenses, (2) archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the lens system, (3) a new velocity-dispersion measurement of the lens galaxy of 323 $\pm$ 20 km s-1 based on Keck spectroscopy, and (4) a characterization of the line-of-sight structures via observations of the lens' environment and ray tracing through the Millennium Simulation. Our blind analysis is designed to prevent experimenter bias. The joint analysis of the data sets allows a time-delay distance measurement to 6% precision that takes into account all known systematic uncertainties. In combination with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe seven-year (WMAP7) data set in flat wCDM cosmology, our unblinded cosmological constraints for RXJ1131-1231 are H_0=80.0^{+5.8}_{-5.7} km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}, Ωde = 0.79 $\pm$ 0.03, and w=-1.25^{+0.17}_{-0.21}. We find the results to be statistically consistent with those from the analysis of the gravitational lens B1608+656, permitting us to combine the inferences from these two lenses. The joint constraints from the two lenses and WMAP7 are H_0=75.2^{+4.4}_{-4.2} km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}, Ω _de=0.76^{+0.02}_{-0.03}, and w = -1.14^{+0.17}_{-0.20} in flat wCDM, and H_0=73.1^{+2.4}_{-3.6} km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}, Ω_{Λ}= 0.75^{+0.01}_{-0.02}, and Ω_k=0.003^{+0.005}_{-0.006} in open ΛCDM. Time-delay lenses constrain especially tightly the Hubble constant H 0 (5.7% and 4.0% respectively in wCDM and open ΛCDM) and curvature of the universe. The overall information content is similar to that of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation experiments. Thus, they complement well other cosmological probes, and provide an independent check of unknown systematics. Our measurement of the Hubble constant is completely independent of those based on the local distance ladder method, providing an important consistency check of the standard cosmological model and of general relativity.},

title = {The shear power spectrum from the COMBO-17 survey},
abstract = {We perform a statistical weak lensing or `cosmic shear' analysis of the COMBO-17 survey - a unique data set with shear quality R-band imaging and accurate photometric redshift estimates (σz= 0.05) for ~90 per cent of galaxies to mR<= 24.0. We undertake a full maximum likelihood analysis to measure directly from the data the weak lensing power spectra, Cκκl, Cββl and Cκβl in five band powers from l= 400 to l= 104, where κ is the usual lens convergence and β is an odd-parity `curl' component of the shear signal. We find a strong measurement of the convergence power over five fields. The non-gravitational β-field has a much lower significance, indicating our data are free of major systematics, while the cross-correlation of κ and β is consistent with zero. We have also calculated the shear correlation functions and variance over a range of scales between 0.5 and 20 arcmin. Our measurements of minimal star-galaxy correlations and cross-correlations between galaxy components provide further evidence that any systematics are negligible. In addition, we have used our results to measure cosmological parameters, constraining the normalization of the matter power spectrum to be σ8= (0.72 +/- 0.09)(Ωm/0.3)-0.49, where the errors quoted are 1σ due to the intrinsic dispersion in galaxy ellipticities, cosmic and sampling variance. We have significantly reduced the usual additional uncertainty in the median redshift (zm) of the source galaxies by estimating zm directly from our data using accurate photometric redshift information from the COMBO-17 multi-band wide-field survey. To demonstrate the power of accurate redshift information, we have also measured parameters from a shear analysis of only those galaxies for which accurate redshift estimates are available. In this case, we have eliminated the uncertainty in the redshift distribution of sources and we show that the uncertainties in the resulting parameter constraints are reduced by more than a factor of 2 compared with the typical uncertainties found in cosmic shear surveys to date. Finally, we combine our parameter measurements with constraints from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey and with those from the cosmic microwave background. With these additional constraints, we measure the normalization of the matter power spectrum to be σ8= 0.73+0.06-0.03 and the matter density of the Universe to be Ωm= 0.27+0.02-0.01.},

We use data from the 154 deg2 covered by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). Our study is the first attempt to quantitatively characterize the scientific value of lensing maps, which could serve in the future as a complementary approach to the study of the dark universe with gravitational lensing. We show that mass maps contain unique cosmological information beyond that of traditional two-point statistical analysis techniques. Using a series of numerical simulations, we first show how, reproducing the CFHTLenS observing conditions, gravitational lensing inversion provides a reliable estimate of the projected matter distribution of large-scale structure. We validate our analysis by quantifying the robustness of the maps with various statistical estimators. We then apply the same process to the CFHTLenS data. We find that the two-point correlation function of the projected mass is consistent with the cosmological analysis performed on the shear correlation function discussed in the CFHTLenS companion papers. The maps also lead to a significant measurement of the third-order moment of the projected mass, which is in agreement with analytic predictions, and to a marginal detection of the fourth-order moment. Tests for residual systematics are found to be consistent with zero for the statistical estimators we used. A new approach for the comparison of the reconstructed mass map to that predicted from the galaxy distribution reveals the existence of giant voids in the dark matter maps as large as 3$\,^{\circ}$ on the sky. Our analysis shows that lensing mass maps are not only consistent with the results obtained by the traditional shear approach, but they also appear promising for new techniques such as peak statistics and the morphological analysis of the projected dark matter distribution.},

We demonstrate that the redshift probability distribution function summed over galaxies provides an accurate representation of the galaxy redshift distribution accounting for random and catastrophic errors for galaxies with best fitting photometric redshifts z_p < 1.3. We present cosmological constraints using tomographic weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure. We use two broad redshift bins 0.5 < z_p <= 0.85 and 0.85 < z_p <= 1.3 free of intrinsic alignment contamination, and measure the shear correlation function on angular scales in the range ~1-40 arcmin. We show that the problematic redshift scaling of the shear signal, found in previous CFHTLS data analyses, does not afflict the CFHTLenS data. For a flat Lambda-CDM model and a fixed matter density Omega_m=0.27, we find the normalisation of the matter power spectrum sigma_8=0.771 \pm 0.041. When combined with cosmic microwave background data (WMAP7), baryon acoustic oscillation data (BOSS), and a prior on the Hubble constant from the HST distance ladder, we find that CFHTLenS improves the precision of the fully marginalised parameter estimates by an average factor of 1.5-2. Combining our results with the above cosmological probes, we find Omega_m=0.2762 \pm 0.0074 and sigma_8=0.802 \pm 0.013.},

abstract = {We present the automated techniques we have developed for new software that optimally detects, de-blends, measures and classifies sources from astronomical images: SExtractor (Source Extractor). We show that a very reliable star/galaxy separation can be achieved on most images using a neural network trained with simulated images. Salient features of SExtractor include its ability to work on very large images, with minimal human intervention, and to deal with a wide variety of object shapes and magnitudes. It is therefore particularly suited to the analysis of large extragalactic surveys.},

title = {HerMES: detection of cosmic magnification of submillimetre galaxies using angular cross-correlation},
abstract = {Cosmic magnification is due to the weak gravitational lensing of sources in the distant Universe by foreground large-scale structure leading to coherent changes in the observed number density of the background sources. Depending on the slope of the background source number counts, cosmic magnification causes a correlation between the background and foreground galaxies, which is unexpected in the absence of lensing if the two populations are spatially disjoint. Previous attempts using submillimetre (submm) sources have been hampered by small number statistics. The large number of sources detected in the Herschel Multi-tiered Extra-galactic Survey (HerMES) Lockman-Spitzer Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic (SWIRE) field enables us to carry out the first robust study of the cross-correlation between submm sources and sources at lower redshifts. Using ancillary data, we compile two low-redshift samples from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and SWIRE with <z>˜ 0.2 and 0.4, respectively, and cross-correlate with two submm samples based on flux density and colour criteria, selecting galaxies preferentially at z˜ 2. We detect cross-correlation on angular scales between ˜1 and 50 arcmin and find clear evidence that this is primarily due to cosmic magnification. A small, but non-negligible signal from intrinsic clustering is likely to be present due to the tails of the redshift distribution of the submm sources overlapping with those of the foreground samples. Herschel is a European Space Agency (ESA) space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principle Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

title = {Cosmic Structure Growth and Dark Energy},
abstract = { Dark energy has a dramatic effect on the dynamics of the universe, causing the recently discovered acceleration of the expansion. The dynamics are also central to the behavior of the growth of large scale structure, offering the possibility that observations of structure formation provide a sensitive probe of the cosmology and dark energy characteristics. In particular, dark energy with a time varying equation of state can have an influence on structure formation stretching back well into the matter dominated epoch. We analyze this impact, first calculating the linear perturbation results, including those for weak gravitational lensing. These dynamical models possess definite observable differences from constant equation of state models. Then we present a large scale numerical simulation of structure formation, including the largest volume to date involving a time varying equation of state. We find the halo mass function is well described by the Jenkins et al. mass function formula. We also show how to interpret modifications of the Friedmann equation in terms of a time variable equation of state. The results presented here provide steps toward realistic computation of the effect of dark energy in cosmological probes involving large scale structure, such as cluster counts, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, or weak gravitational lensing. },

Quasar-galaxy associations, if due to microlensing, provide, in principle, a very clean probe of the mass distribution around galaxies.

title = {IM3SHAPE: a maximum likelihood galaxy shear measurement code for cosmic gravitational lensing},
abstract = {We present and describe IM3SHAPE, a new publicly available galaxy shape measurement code for weak gravitational lensing shear. IM3SHAPE performs a maximum likelihood fit of a bulge-plus-disc galaxy model to noisy images, incorporating an applied point spread function. We detail challenges faced and choices made in its design and implementation, and then discuss various limitations that affect this and other maximum likelihood methods. We assess the bias arising from fitting an incorrect galaxy model using simple noise-free images and find that it should not be a concern for current cosmic shear surveys. We test IM3SHAPE on the Gravitational Lensing Accuracy Testing 2008 (GREAT08) challenge image simulations, and meet the requirements for upcoming cosmic shear surveys in the case that the simulations are encompassed by the fitted model, using a simple correction for image noise bias. For the fiducial branch of GREAT08 we obtain a negligible additive shear bias and sub-two per cent level multiplicative bias, which is suitable for analysis of current surveys. We fall short of the sub-per cent level requirement for upcoming surveys, which we attribute to a combination of noise bias and the mismatch between our galaxy model and the model used in the GREAT08 simulations. We meet the requirements for current surveys across all branches of GREAT08, except those with small or high noise galaxies, which we would cut from our analysis. Using the GREAT08 metric we we obtain a score of Q = 717 for the usable branches, relative to the goal of Q = 1000 for future experiments.

title = {Direct Measurements of the magnification produced by galaxy clusters as gravitational lenses},
abstract = {Weak lensing is one of the best available diagnostic tools to measure the total density profiles of distant clusters of galaxies. Unfortunately, it suffers from the well-known mass-sheet degeneracy, so that weak lensing analyses cannot lead to fully reliable determinations of the total mass of the clusters. One possible way to set the relevant scale of the density profile would be to make a direct measurement of the magnification produced by the clusters as gravitational lenses. In this paper we revisit a suggestion made a few years ago for this general purpose, based on the use of the Fundamental Plane as a standard rod for early-type galaxies. Here we move one step further, beyond the simple outline of the idea given earlier, and quantify some statistical properties of this innovative diagnostic tool, with the final goal of identifying clear guidelines for a future observational test on concrete cases, which turns out to be well within the current instrument capabilities. The study is carried out by discussing the statistical properties of Fundamental Plane measurements for a sample of early-type source galaxies behind a massive cluster, for which a weak lensing analysis is assumed to be available. We proceed to study the best strategy to use Fundamental Plane measurements to determine the mass scale of a given cluster and find that the optimal choice is that of a sample of early-type galaxies behind the cluster distributed approximately uniformly in the sky. We also show that substructures do not contribute much to the magnification signal that we are looking for, but only add a modest amount of scatter. We find that for a massive cluster (M > 10^15 M_Sun) located at redshift 0.3 +/- 0.1, a set of about 20 Fundamental Plane measurements, combined with a good weak lensing analysis, should be able to lead to a mass determination with a precision of 20% or better.},

title = {Weak gravitational lensing effects on cosmological parameters and dark energy from gamma-ray bursts},
abstract = {Context. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are attractive objects for constraining the nature of dark energy in a way complementary to other cosmological probes, especially at high redshifts. However, the apparent magnitude of distant GRBs can be distorted by the gravitational lensing from the density fluctuations along the line of sight. Aims: We investigate the gravitational lensing effect on the cosmological parameters and dark energy equation of state from GRBs. Methods: We first calibrated the GRB luminosity relations without assuming any cosmological models. The luminosity distances of low-redshift GRBs were calibrated with the cosmography method using a latest type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) sample. The luminosity distances of high-redshift GRBs were derived by assuming that the luminosity relations do not evolve with redshift. Then we investigated the non-Gaussian nature of the magnification probability distribution functions and the magnification bias of the gravitational lensing. Results: We find that the gravitational lensing has non-negligible effects on the determination of cosmological parameters and dark energy. The gravitational lensing shifts the best-fit constraints on cosmological parameters and dark energy. Because high-redshift GRBs are more likely to be reduced, the most probable value of the observed matter density ΩM is slightly lower than its actual value. In the ΛCDM model, we find that the matter density parameter ΩM will shift from 0.30 to 0.26 after including the gravitational lensing effect. The gravitational lensing also affects the dark energy equation of state by shifting it to a more negative value. We constrain the dark energy equation of state out to redshift z ~ 8 using GRBs for the first time, and find that the equation of state deviates from ΛCDM at the 1σ confidence level, but agrees with w = -1 at the 2σ confidence level.},

title = {Polarization as an indicator of intrinsic alignment in radio weak lensing},
abstract = {We propose a new technique for weak gravitational lensing in the radio band making use of polarization information. Since the orientation of a galaxy's polarized emission is both unaffected by lensing and is related to the galaxy's intrinsic orientation, it effectively provides information on the unlensed galaxy position angle. We derive a new weak-lensing estimator, which exploits this effect and makes full use of both the observed galaxy shapes and the estimates of the intrinsic position angles as provided by polarization. Our method has the potential both to reduce the effects of shot noise and to reduce to negligible levels, in a model-independent way, all effects of intrinsic galaxy alignments. We test our technique on simulated weak-lensing skies, including an intrinsic alignment contaminant consistent with recent observations, in three overlapping redshift bins. Adopting a standard weak-lensing analysis and ignoring intrinsic alignments results in biases of 5-10 per cent in the recovered power spectra and cosmological parameters. Applying our new estimator to one-tenth the number of galaxies used for the standard case, we recover both power spectra and the input cosmology with similar precision and with negligible residual bias. This remains true even in the presence of a substantial (astrophysical) scatter in the relationship between the observed orientation of the polarized emission and the intrinsic orientation. Assuming a reasonable polarization fraction for star-forming galaxies, and no cosmological conspiracy in the relationship between polarization direction and intrinsic morphology, our estimator should prove a valuable tool for weak-lensing analyses of forthcoming radio surveys, in particular, deep wide-field surveys with e-MERLIN, MeerKAT and ASKAP, and ultimately, definitive radio lensing surveys with the SKA.},

Using a flux-limited sample of 127,001 lens galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts and mean luminosity <L>~L* and 9,020,388 source galaxies with photometric redshifts, we invert the lensing signal to obtain the galaxy-mass correlation function ξgm. We find ξgm is consistent with a power law, ξgm=(r/r0)-γ, with best-fit parameters γ=1.79+/-0.06 and r0=(5.4+/-0.7)(0.27/Ωm)1/γh-1 Mpc. At fixed separation, the ratio ξgg/ξgm=b/r, where b is the bias and r is the correlation coefficient. Comparing with the galaxy autocorrelation function for a similarly selected sample of SDSS galaxies, we find that b/r is approximately scale-independent over scales 0.2-6.7 h-1 Mpc, with mean <b/r>=(1.3+/-0.2)(Ωm/0.27). We also find no scale dependence in b/r for a volume-limited sample of luminous galaxies (-23.0<Mr<-21.5). The mean b/r for this sample is <b/r>Vlim=(2.0+/-0.7)(Ωm/0.27). We split the lens galaxy sample into subsets based on luminosity, color, spectral type, and velocity dispersion and see clear trends of the lensing signal with each of these parameters. The amplitude and logarithmic slope of ξgm increase with galaxy luminosity. For high luminosities (L~5L*), ξgm deviates significantly from a power law. These trends with luminosity also appear in the subsample of red galaxies, which are more strongly clustered than blue galaxies.},

title = {Cosmology from supernova magnification maps},
abstract = { High-z Type Ia supernovae are expected to be gravitationally lensed by the foreground distribution of large-scale structure. The resulting magnification of supernovae is statistically measurable, and the angular correlation of the magnification pattern directly probes the integrated mass density along the line of sight. Measurements of cosmic magnification of supernovae therefore complements galaxy shear measurements in providing a direct measure of clustering of the dark matter. As the number of supernovae is typically much smaller than the number of sheared galaxies, the two-point correlation function of lensed Type Ia supernovae suffers from significantly increased shot noise. Neverthless, we find that the magnification map of a large sample of supernovae, such as that expected from next generation dedicated searches, will be easily measurable and provide an important cosmological tool. For example, a search over 20 sq. deg. over five years leading to a sample of ~ 10,000 supernovae would measure the angular power spectrum of cosmic magnification with a cumulative signal-to-noise ratio of ~20. This detection can be further improved once the supernova distance measurements are cross-correlated with measurements of the foreground galaxy distribution. The magnification maps made using supernovae can be used for important cross-checks with traditional lensing shear statistics obtained in the same fields, as well as help to control systematics. We discuss two applications of supernova magnification maps: the breaking of the mass-sheet degeneracy when estimating masses of shear-detected clusters, and constraining the second-order corrections to weak lensing observables. },

abstract = {We use a simplified version of the halo model with a power law power spectrum to study scale dependence in galaxy bias at the very large scales relevant to baryon oscillations. In addition to providing a useful pedagogical explanation of the scale dependence of galaxy bias, the model provides an analytic tool for studying how changes in the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) impact the scale dependence of galaxy bias on scales between 10 and 1000 Mpc/h, which is useful for interpreting the results of complex N-body simulations. We find that changing the mean number of galaxies per halo of a given mass will change the scale dependence of the bias, but that changing the way the galaxies are distributed within the halo has a smaller effect on the scale dependence of bias at large scales. We use the model to explain the decay in amplitude of the baryon oscillations as k increases, and generalize the model to make predictions about scale dependent galaxy bias when redshift space distortions are introduced.},

title = {On measuring the absolute scale of baryon acoustic oscillations},
abstract = {The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the distribution of galaxies provides a fundamental standard ruler which is widely used to constrain cosmological parameters. In most analyses, the comoving length of the ruler is inferred from a combination of CMB observations and theory. However, this inferred length may be biased by various non-standard effects in early universe physics; this can lead to biased inferences of cosmological parameters such as H_0, {\O}mega_m and w, so it would be valuable to measure the absolute BAO length by combining a galaxy redshift survey and a suitable direct low-z distance measurement. One obstacle is that low-redshift BAO surveys mainly constrain the ratio r_S / D_V(z), where D_V is a dilation scale which is not directly observable by standard candles. Here, we find a new approximation D_V(z) \simeq (3/4) D_L(4z/3) (1+ 4z/3)^{-1} (1 - 0.02455 z^3 + 0.0105 z^4) which connects D_V to the standard luminosity distance D_L at a somewhat higher redshift; this is shown to be very accurate (relative error < 0.2 percent) for all WMAP-compatible Friedmann models at z < 0.4, with very weak dependence on cosmological parameters H_0, {\O}mega_m, {\O}mega_k, w. This provides a route to measure the absolute BAO length using only observations at z < 0.3, including type-Ia supernovae, and potentially future H_0-free physical distance indicators such as gravitational lenses or gravitational wave standard sirens. This would provide a zero-parameter check of the standard cosmology at 10^3 < z < 10^5, and can constrain the number of relativistic species N_{eff} with fewer degeneracies than the CMB.},

abstract = {The use of large, X-ray selected galaxy cluster catalogs for cosmological analyses requires a thorough understanding of the X-ray mass estimates, including the possibility of biases due to the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. Weak gravitational lensing is an ideal method to shed light on such issues, due to its insensitivity to the cluster dynamical state. We perform a weak lensing calibration of 166 galaxy clusters from the RBC cluster catalog and compare our results to the hydrostatic X-ray masses from that catalog. To interpret the weak lensing signal in terms of cluster masses, we compare the lensing signal to simple theoretical Navarro-Frenk-White models and to simulated cluster lensing profiles, including complications such as cluster substructure, projected large-scale structure, and Malmquist bias. We find evidence of underestimation in the X-ray masses, as expected, with {\$}<M_{\mathrm{X}}/M_{\mathrm{WL}}>= 0.66_{-0.12}^{+0.07}{\$} for our best-fit model, a more than {\$}4\sigma{\$} detection of a bias between X-ray and weak lensing masses. The biases in cosmological parameters in a typical cluster abundance measurement that ignores this mass bias will typically exceed the statistical errors.},

abstract = {We present a comparison of Fisher matrix forecasts for cosmological probes with Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) posterior likelihood estimation methods. We analyse the performance of future Dark Energy Task Force (DETF) stage-III and stage-IV dark-energy surveys using supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations and weak lensing as probes. We concentrate in particular on the dark-energy equation of state parameters w_0 and w_a. For purely geometrical probes, and especially when marginalising over w_a, we find considerable disagreement between the two methods, since in this case the Fisher matrix can not reproduce the highly non-elliptical shape of the likelihood function. More quantitatively, the Fisher method overestimates the DETF figure of merit (FoM) for purely geometrical probes by a factor of up to seven. For cases including structure formation such as weak lensing, we find that the posterior probability contours from the Fisher matrix estimation are in good agreement with the MCMC contours. We then explore non-linear transformations resulting in physically-motivated parameters and investigate whether these parameterisations exhibit a Gaussian behaviour. We conclude that for the purely geometrical probes and, more generally, in cases where it is not known whether the likelihood is close to Gaussian, the Fisher matrix is not the appropriate tool to produce reliable forecasts.},

abstract = { Conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC) posits the existence of an aeon preceding our Big Bang 'B', whose conformal infinity 'I' is identified, conformally, with 'B', now regarded as a spacelike 3-surface. Black-hole encounters, within bound galactic clusters in that previous aeon, would have the observable effect, in our CMB sky, of families of concentric circles over which the temperature variance is anomalously low, the centre of each such family representing the point of 'I' at which the cluster converges. These centres appear as fairly randomly distributed fixed points in our CMB sky. The analysis of Wilkinson Microwave Background Probe's (WMAP) cosmic microwave background 7-year maps does indeed reveal such concentric circles, of up to 6{\sigma} significance. This is confirmed when the same analysis is applied to BOOMERanG98 data, eliminating the possibility of an instrumental cause for the effects. These observational predictions of CCC would not be easily explained within standard inflationary cosmology. },

abstract = {We present the analysis of a large sample of early-type galaxies (ETGs) at 0 < z < 3 aimed at tracing the cosmic evolution of their size and compare it with a model of pure dissipationless (dry) merging in the Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) framework. The effective radius Re depends on stellar mass ? as ? with α˜ 0.5 at all redshifts. The redshift evolution of the mass- or SDSS-normalized size can be reproduced as ∝(1 +z)β with β˜-1, with the most massive ETGs possibly showing the fastest evolutionary rate (β˜-1.4). This size evolution slows down significantly to β˜-0.6 if the ETGs at z > 2 are removed from the sample, suggesting an accelerated increase of the typical sizes at z > 2, especially for the ETGs with the largest masses. A pure dry merging ΛCDM model is marginally consistent with the average size evolution at 0 < z < 1.7, but predicts descendants too compact for z > 2 progenitor ETGs. This opens the crucial question on what physical mechanism can explain the accelerated evolution at z > 2, or whether an unclear observational bias is partly responsible for that.},

title = {The radial distribution of galaxies in groups and clusters},
abstract = {We present a new catalogue of 55,121 groups and clusters centred on Luminous Red Galaxies from SDSS DR7 in the redshift range 0.15<z<0.4. We provide halo mass estimates for each of these groups derived from a calibration between the optical richness of bright galaxies (M_r<-20.5) within 1 Mpc, and X-ray-derived mass for a small subset of 129 groups and clusters with X-ray measurements. We derive the mean (stacked) surface number density profiles of galaxies as a function of total halo mass in different mass bins. We find that derived profiles can be well-described by a projected NFW profile with a concentration parameter (<c>~2.6) that is approximately a factor of two lower than that of the dark matter (as predicted by N-body cosmological simulations) and nearly independent of halo mass. Interestingly, in spite of the difference in shape between the galaxy and dark matter radial distributions, both exhibit a high degree of self-similarity. A self-consistent comparison to several recent semi-analytic models of galaxy formation indicates that: (1) beyond ~0.3 r_500 current models are able to reproduce both the shape and normalisation of the satellite profiles; and (2) within ~0.3 r_500 the predicted profiles are sensitive to the details of the satellite-BCG merger timescale calculation. The former is a direct result of the models being tuned to match the global galaxy luminosity function combined with the assumption that the satellite galaxies do not suffer significant tidal stripping, even though their surrounding dark matter haloes can be removed through this process. Combining our results with measurements of the intracluster light should provide a way to inform theoretical models on the efficacy of the tidal stripping and merging processes.},

abstract = {We observe a large excess of power in the statistical clustering of Luminous Red Galaxies in the photometric SDSS galaxy sample called MegaZ DR7. This is seen over the lowest multipoles in the angular power spectra C_{\ell} in four equally spaced redshift bins between 0.45 < z < 0.65. However, it is most prominent in the highest redshift band at ~ 4 sigma and it emerges at an effective scale k ~ 0.01 h Mpc^{-1}. Given that MegaZ DR7 is the largest cosmic volume galaxy survey to date (3.3 (Gpc h^{-1})^3) this implies an anomaly on the largest physical scales probed by galaxies. Alternatively, this signature could be a consequence of it appearing at the most systematically susceptible redshift. There are several explanations for this excess power that range from systematics to new physics. This could have important consequences for the next generation of galaxy surveys or the LCDM model. We test the survey, data and excess power, as well as possible origins.},

title = {Safety in Numbers: Gravitational Lensing Degradation of the Luminosity Distance-Redshift Relation},
abstract = {Observation of the expansion history of the universe allows exploration of the physical properties and energy density of the universe's various constituents. Standardizable candles such as Type Ia supernovae remain one of the most promising and robust tools in this endeavor by allowing for a direct measure of the luminosity distance-redshift curve and thereby producing detailed studies of the dark energy responsible for the universe's currently accelerating expansion. As such observations are pushed to higher redshifts, the observed flux is increasingly affected by gravitational lensing magnification due to intervening structure along the line of sight. We simulate and analyze the non-Gaussian probability distribution function of deamplification and amplification due to lensing of standard candles, quantify the effect of a convolution over many independent sources (which acts to restore the intrinsic average [unlensed] luminosity due to flux conservation), and compute the additional uncertainty due to lensing on derived cosmological parameters. We find that, in the case of large numbers of sources, the lensing distribution along any particular line of sight can be approximated by a Gaussian with standard deviation given by σeff=0.088z as a function of redshift z. The resulting ``degradation factor'' due to lensing is a factor of 3 reduction in the effective number of usable supernovae at z=1.5 (for sources with intrinsic flux dispersion of 10%).},

title = {The Lens Parallax Method: Determining Redshifts of Faint Blue Galaxies through Gravitational Lensing},
abstract = {We propose a new technique, which we call the lens parallax method, to determine simultaneously the redshift distribution of the faint blue galaxies and the mass distributions of foreground clusters of galaxies. The method is based on gravitational lensing and makes use of the following: (1) the amplitude of lensing-induced distortions of background galaxies increases with redshift; (2) the surface brightnesses of galaxies decrease steeply with redshift The distortions of galaxy images due to lensing are thus expected to be inversely correlated with surface brightness, allowing us to obtain relative distances to galaxies as a function of surface brightness. If the redshifts of the brightest galaxies are measured, then the relative distance scale can be converted to mean galaxy redshifts as a function of surface brightness. Further, by comparing the angular sizes of lensed galaxies with those of similar galaxies in empty control fields, it is possible to break the so-called mass sheet degeneracy inherent to cluster mass reconstruction techniques that are based purely on image ellipticities. This allows an unambiguous determination of the surface density of a lensing cluster. We describe an iterative algorithm based on these ideas and present numerical simulations which show that the proposed techniques are feasible with a sample of ≍10 rich clusters at moderate redshifts ˜0.3-0.4 and an equal number of control fields. The numerical tests show that the method can be used to determine the redshifts of galaxies with an accuracy of Δz ≍ 0.1-0.2 at z ˜1-1.7, and to measure the masses of lensing clusters to about 5% accuracy.},

title = {Optimizing cosmic shear surveys to measure modifications to gravity on cosmic scales},
abstract = {We consider how upcoming photometric large-scale structure surveys can be optimized to measure the properties of dark energy (DE) and possible cosmic-scale modifications to General Relativity in light of realistic astrophysical and instrumental systematic uncertainties. In particular, we include flexible descriptions of intrinsic alignments (IAs), galaxy bias and photometric redshift uncertainties in a Fisher Matrix analysis of shear, position and position-shear correlations, including complementary cosmological constraints from the cosmic microwave background. We study the impact of survey trade-offs in depth versus breadth, and redshift quality. We parametrize the results in terms of the Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit, and deviations from General Relativity through an analogous modified gravity (MG) figure of merit. We find that IAs weaken the dependence of figure of merit on area and that, for a fixed observing time, halving the area of a Stage IV reduces the figure of merit by 20 per cent when IAs are not included and by only 10 per cent when IAs are included. While reducing photometric redshift scatter improves constraining power, the dependence is shallow. The variation in constraining power is stronger once IAs are included and is slightly more pronounced for MG constraints than for DE. The inclusion of IAs and galaxy position information reduces the required prior on photometric redshift accuracy by an order of magnitude for both the fiducial Stage III and IV surveys, equivalent to a factor of 100 reduction in the number of spectroscopic galaxies required to calibrate the photometric sample.},

title = {Testing dark energy paradigms with weak gravitational lensing},
abstract = {Any theory invoked to explain cosmic acceleration predicts consistency relations between the expansion history, structure growth, and all related observables. Currently there exist high-quality measurements of the expansion history from Type Ia supernovae, the cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization spectra, and baryon acoustic oscillations. We can use constraints from these datasets to predict what future probes of structure growth should observe. We apply this method to predict what range of cosmic shear power spectra would be expected if we lived in a LambdaCDM universe, with or without spatial curvature, and what results would be inconsistent and therefore falsify the model. Though predictions are relaxed if one allows for an arbitrary quintessence equation of state {\$}-1\le w(z)\le 1{\$}, we find that any observation that rules out LambdaCDM due to excess lensing will also rule out all quintessence models, with or without early dark energy. We further explore how uncertainties in the nonlinear matter power spectrum, e.g. from approximate fitting formulas such as Halofit, warm dark matter, or baryons, impact these limits.},

title = {On the Accuracy of Weak Lensing Cluster Mass Reconstructions},
abstract = {We study the bias and scatter in mass measurements of galaxy clusters resulting from fitting a spherically-symmetric Navarro, Frenk {\&} White model to the reduced tangential shear profile measured in weak lensing observations. The reduced shear profiles are generated for ~10^4 cluster-sized halos formed in a LCDM cosmological N-body simulation of a 1 Gpc/h box. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the scatter in the weak lensing masses derived using this fitting method has irreducible contributions from the triaxial shapes of cluster-sized halos and uncorrelated large-scale matter projections along the line-of-sight. Additionally, we find that correlated large-scale structure within several virial radii of clusters contributes a smaller, but nevertheless significant, amount to the scatter. The intrinsic scatter due to these physical sources is ~20% for massive clusters, and can be as high as ~30% for group-sized systems. For current, ground-based observations, however, the total scatter should be dominated by shape noise from the background galaxies used to measure the shear. Importantly, we find that weak lensing mass measurements can have a small, ~5%-10%, but non-negligible amount of bias. Given that weak lensing measurements of cluster masses are a powerful way to calibrate cluster mass-observable relations for precision cosmological constraints, we strongly emphasize that a robust calibration of the bias requires detailed simulations which include more observational effects than we consider here. Such a calibration exercise needs to be carried out for each specific weak lensing mass estimation method, as the details of the method determine in part the expected scatter and bias. We present an iterative method for estimating mass M500c that can eliminate the bias for analyses of ground-based data.},

title = {Deep Optical Galaxy Counts with the Keck Telescope},
abstract = {We present faint galaxy counts from deep VRI images obtained with the Keck Telescope. These images reach R ~ 27 in median seeing FWHM ~ 0."5--0."6 , and we detect a integrated galaxy number density of 7 x 105 deg-2, equivalent to 3 x 1010 galaxies in the observable universe. In addition we present median galaxy colors as a function of magnitude; bluing trends are visible in all colors to R ~ 24.5. Fainter than R ~ 24.5, however, the typical V - R color becomes redder again, V - I remains constant, and R - I becomes yet bluer. These trends are consistent with the VRI count slopes, implying a decrease in the V slope at the faintest levels, which our data support. Taking advantage of our good seeing we also present median half-light radii for faint galaxies; these show a steady decline at fainter magnitudes, leading to an intrinsic half-light radius of ~ 0."2 for a typical R ~ 26 galaxy. Irrespective of the redshift distribution, the extremely high galaxy surface densities and their small intrinsic sizes are consistent with a scenario in which the majority of the very faint field population are dwarf galaxies or subgalactic units.},

abstract = {The potential of cosmic shear to probe cosmology is well recognized and future optical wide field surveys are currently being designed to optimize the return of cosmic shear science. High precision cosmic shear analysis requires high precision photometric redshift. With accurate photometric redshifts, it becomes possible to measure the cosmic magnification on galaxies by galaxies and use it as a probe of cosmology. This type of weak lensing measurement will not use galaxy shapes, instead it will strongly rely on precise photometry and detailed colour information. In this work it is shown that such a measurement would lead to competitive constraints of the cosmological parameters, with a remarkable complementarity with cosmic shear. Future cosmic shear surveys could gain tremendously from magnification measurements as an independent probe of the dark matter distribution leading to a better control of observational and theoretical systematics when combined with shear.},

We select isolated primaries from the spectroscopic sample and search for potential satellites in the much deeper photometric sample. For specific luminosity primaries we obtain robust statistical results by stacking as many as ~ 50, 000 galaxy systems. We derive accurate projected number density profiles of satellites down to 4 magnitudes fainter than their primaries. We find the normalized satellite profiles generally have a universal form and can be well fitted by projected NFW profiles. The NFW concentration parameter increases with decreasing satellite luminosity while being independent of the luminosity of the primary except for very bright primaries. The profiles of the faintest satellites show deviations from the NFW form with an excess at small galactocentric projected distances. In addition, we quantify how the radial distribution of satellites depends on the colour of the satellites and the colour and concentration of their primaries.},

title = {Cosmological parameter constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering with the SDSS DR7},
abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the cross-correlation coefficient between galaxies and dark matter is very close to unity on scales outside a few virial radii of galaxy haloes, independent of the details of how galaxies populate dark matter haloes. This finding makes it possible to determine the dark matter clustering from measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy clustering. We present new cosmological parameter constraints based on large-scale measurements of spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 7. We generalize the approach of Baldauf et al. to remove small-scale information (below 2 and 4 h-1 Mpc for lensing and clustering measurements, respectively), where the cross-correlation coefficient differs from unity. We derive constraints for three galaxy samples covering 7131 deg2, containing 69 150, 62 150 and 35 088 galaxies with mean redshifts of 0.11, 0.28 and 0.40. We clearly detect scale-dependent galaxy bias for the more luminous galaxy samples, at a level consistent with theoretical expectations. When we vary both σ8 and Ωm (and marginalize over non-linear galaxy bias) in a flat Λ cold dark matter model, the best-constrained quantity is σ8(Ωm/0.25)0.57 = 0.80 $\pm$ 0.05 (1σ, stat. + sys.), where statistical and systematic errors (photometric redshift and shear calibration) have comparable contributions, and we have fixed ns = 0.96 and h = 0.7. These strong constraints on the matter clustering suggest that this method is competitive with cosmic shear in current data, while having very complementary and in some ways less serious systematics. We therefore expect that this method will play a prominent role in future weak lensing surveys. When we combine these data with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7-year (WMAP7) cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, constraints on σ8, Ωm, H0, wde and {\Sigma}mν become 30-80 per cent tighter than with CMB data alone, since our data break several parameter degeneracies.},

The shapes of distant galaxies can be used to determine the properties of dark energy and the nature of gravity, because light from those galaxies is bent by gravity from the intervening dark matter. The observed galaxy images appear distorted, although only slightly, and their shapes must be precisely disentangled from the effects of pixelisation, convolution and noise. The worldwide gravitational lensing community has made significant progress in techniques to measure these distortions via the Shear TEsting Program (STEP). Via STEP, we have run challenges within our own community, and come to recognise that this particular image analysis problem is ideally matched to experts in statistical inference, inverse problems and computational learning. Thus, in order to continue the progress seen in recent years, we are seeking an infusion of new ideas from these communities. This document details the GREAT08 Challenge for potential participants.

title = {Tomography and Weak lensing Statistics},
abstract = {Extending previous studies, we derive generic predictions for lower order cumulants and their correlators for individual tomographic bins as well as between two different bins. We derive the corresponding one- and two-point joint probability distribution function for the tomographic convergence maps from different bins as a function of angular smoothing scale. The modelling of weak lensing statistics is obtained by adopting a detailed prescription for the underlying density contrast. In this paper we concentrate on the convergence field {\$}\kappa{\$} and use top-hat filter; though the techniques presented can readily be extended to model the PDF of shear components or to include other windows such as the compensated filter. The functional form for the underlying PDF and bias is modelled in terms of the non-linear or the quasilinear form depending on the smoothing angular scale. Results from other semi-analytical models e.g. the lognormal distribution are also presented. Introducing a reduced convergence for individual bins, we are able to show that the tomographic PDFs and bias for each bin sample the same functional form of the underlying PDF of density contrast but with varying variance. The joint probability distribution of the convergence maps that correspond to two different tomographic bins can be constructed from individual tomographic PDF and bias. We study their dependence on cosmological parameters for source distributions corresponding to the realistic surveys such as LSST and DES. We briefly outline how photometric redshift information can be incorporated in our computation of cumulants, cumulant correlators and the PDFs. Connection of our results to the full 3D calculations is elucidated. Analytical results for inclusion of realistic noise and finite survey size are presented in detail.},

title = {Cosmic Background Anisotropies in Cold Dark Matter Cosmology},
abstract = {Cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and density fluctuations are calculated for flat cold dark matter (CDM) models with a wide range of parameters, viz., Ω0, h, and ΩB, for standard recombination and for various epochs of reionization. Tables of the power spectrum of CMB anisotropies in the form of C1 values as a function of l are presented. Although the Harrison-Zeldovich initial spectrum is assumed in these tables, we present simple approximations for obtaining the C1 values corresponding to a tilted spectrum from those with a Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum. Values of σ8 are derived for the matter density spectrum, with α(10$\,^{\circ}$), fixed Qrms-PS and COBE Differential Microwave Radiometer (DMR) 2 yr normalizations. Simple modifications of the fitting formula for the density transfer function are given which are applicable for models with high baryon density. By using both numerical results and these fitting formulae, we calculate the relation between α8 and Qrms-PS and find good agreement. In addition, the velocity fields are calculated.},

title = {Three-Point Correlation Functions of SDSS Galaxies: Constraining Galaxy-Mass Bias},
abstract = {We constrain the linear and quadratic bias parameters from the configuration dependence of the three-point correlation function (3PCF) in both redshift and projected space, utilizing measurements of spectroscopic galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Main Galaxy Sample. We show that bright galaxies (M_r < -21.5) are biased tracers of mass, measured at a significance of 4.5 sigma in redshift space and 2.5 sigma in projected space by using a thorough error analysis in the quasi-linear regime (9-27 Mpc/h). Measurements on a fainter galaxy sample are consistent with an unbiased model. We demonstrate that a linear bias model appears sufficient to explain the galaxy-mass bias of our samples, although a model using both linear and quadratic terms results in a better fit. In contrast, the bias values obtained from the linear model appear in better agreement with the data by inspection of the relative bias, and yield implied values of sigma_8 that are more consistent with current constraints. We investigate the covariance of the 3PCF, which itself is a measurement of galaxy clustering. We assess the accuracy of our error estimates by comparing results from mock galaxy catalogs to jackknife re-sampling methods. We identify significant differences in the structure of the covariance. However, the impact of these discrepancies appears to be mitigated by an eigenmode analysis that can account for the noisy, unresolved modes. Our results demonstrate that using this technique is sufficient to remove potential systematics even when using less-than-ideal methods to estimate errors.},

title = {Background sky obscuration by cluster galaxies as a source of systematic error for weak lensing},
abstract = {Lensing magnification and stacked shear measurements of galaxy clusters rely on measuring the density of background galaxies behind the clusters. The most common ways of measuring this quantity ignore the fact that some fraction of the sky is obscured by the cluster galaxies themselves, reducing the area in which background galaxies can be observed. We discuss the size of this effect in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS), finding a minimum 1 per cent effect at {\$}0.1h^{-1}{\$}Mpc from the centers of clusters in SDSS; the effect is an order of magnitude higher in CFHTLenS. The resulting biases on cluster mass and concentration measurements are of the same order as the size of the obscuration effect, which is below the statistical errors for cluster lensing in SDSS but likely exceeds them for CFHTLenS. We also forecast the impact of this systematic error on cluster mass and magnification measurements in several upcoming surveys, and find that it typically exceeds the statistical errors. We conclude that future surveys must account for this effect in stacked lensing and magnification measurements in order to avoid being dominated by systematic error.},

title = {Direct Constraints on the Dark Matter Self-Interaction Cross Section from the Merging Galaxy Cluster 1E 0657-56},
abstract = {We compare new maps of the hot gas, dark matter, and galaxies for 1E 0657-56, a cluster with a rare high-velocity merger occurring nearly in the plane of the sky. The X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like gas subcluster just exiting the collision site. A prominent bow shock gives an estimate of the subcluster velocity, 4500 km s-1, which lies mostly in the plane of the sky. The optical image shows that the gas lags behind the subcluster galaxies. The weak-lensing mass map reveals a dark matter clump lying ahead of the collisional gas bullet but coincident with the effectively collisionless galaxies. From these observations, one can directly estimate the cross section of the dark matter self-interaction. That the dark matter is not fluid-like is seen directly in the X-ray-lensing mass overlay; more quantitative limits can be derived from three simple independent arguments. The most sensitive constraint, σ/m<1 cm2 g-1, comes from the consistency of the subcluster mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster (and universal) value, which rules out a significant mass loss due to dark matter particle collisions. This limit excludes most of the 0.5-5 cm2 g-1 interval proposed to explain the flat mass profiles in galaxies. Our result is only an order-of-magnitude estimate that involves a number of simplifying, but always conservative, assumptions; stronger constraints may be derived using hydrodynamic simulations of this cluster.},

title = {Analysis of two-point statistics of cosmic shear. I. Estimators and covariances},
abstract = {Recently, cosmic shear, the weak lensing effect by the inhomogeneous matter distribution in the Universe, has not only been detected by several groups, but the observational results have been used to derive constraints on cosmological parameters. For this purpose, several cosmic shear statistics have been employed. As shown recently, all second-order statistical measures can be expressed in terms of the two-point correlation functions of the shear, which thus represents the basic quantity; also, from a practical point-of-view, the two-point correlation functions are easiest to obtain from observational data which typically have complicated geometry. We derive in this paper expressions for the covariance matrix of the cosmic shear two-point correlation functions which are readily applied to any survey geometry. Furthermore, we consider the more special case of a simple survey geometry which allows us to obtain approximations for the covariance matrix in terms of integrals which are readily evaluated numerically. These results are then used to study the covariance of the aperture mass dispersion which has been employed earlier in quantitative cosmic shear analyses. We show that the aperture mass dispersion, measured at two different angular scales, quickly decorrelates with the ratio of the scales. Inverting the relation between the shear two-point correlation functions and the power spectrum of the underlying projected matter distribution, we construct estimators for the power spectrum and for the band powers, and show that they yields accurate approximations; in particular, the correlation between band powers at different wave numbers is quite weak. The covariance matrix of the shear correlation function is then used to investigate the expected accuracy of cosmological parameter estimates from cosmic shear surveys. Depending on the use of prior information, e.g. from CMB measurements, cosmic shear can yield very accurate determinations of several cosmological parameters, in particular the normalization sigma_8 of the power spectrum of the matter distribution, the matter density parameter {cal O}mega_m, and the shape parameter Gamma .},

title = {Cosmology with weak lensing surveys},
abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing is responsible for the shearing and magnification of the images of high-redshift sources due to the presence of intervening matter. The distortions are due to fluctuations in the gravitational potential, and are directly related to the distribution of matter and to the geometry and dynamics of the Universe. As a consequence, weak gravitational lensing offers unique possibilities for probing the Dark Matter and Dark Energy in the Universe. In this review, we summarise the theoretical and observational state of the subject, focussing on the statistical aspects of weak lensing, and consider the prospects for weak lensing surveys in the future. Weak gravitational lensing surveys are complementary to both galaxy surveys and cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations as they probe the unbiased non-linear matter power spectrum at modest redshifts. Most of the cosmological parameters are accurately estimated from CMB and large-scale galaxy surveys, so the focus of attention is shifting to understanding the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. On the theoretical side, recent advances in the use of 3D information of the sources from photometric redshifts promise greater statistical power, and these are further enhanced by the use of statistics beyond two-point quantities such as the power spectrum. The use of 3D information also alleviates difficulties arising from physical effects such as the intrinsic alignment of galaxies, which can mimic weak lensing to some extent. On the observational side, in the next few years weak lensing surveys such as CFHTLS, VST-KIDS and Pan-STARRS, and the planned Dark Energy Survey, will provide the first weak lensing surveys covering very large sky areas and depth. In the long run even more ambitious programmes such as DUNE, the Supernova Anisotropy Probe (SNAP) and Large-aperture Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) are planned. Weak lensing of diffuse components such as the CMB and 21 cm emission can also provide valuable cosmological information. Finally, we consider the prospects for joint analysis with other probes, such as (1) the CMB to probe background cosmology (2) galaxy surveys to probe large-scale bias and (3) Sunyaev Zeldovich surveys to study small-scale baryonic physics, and consider the lensing effect on cosmological supernova observations.},

The density inference is based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 7, which covers the northern galactic cap. We employ a novel Bayesian sampling algorithm, which enables us to explore the extremely high dimensional non-Gaussian, non-linear log-normal Poissonian posterior of the three dimensional density field conditional on the data. These techniques are efficiently implemented in the HADES computer algorithm and permit the precise recovery of poorly sampled objects and non-linear density fields. The non-linear density inference is performed on a 750 Mpc cube with roughly 3 Mpc grid-resolution, while accounting for systematic effects, introduced by survey geometry and selection function of the SDSS, and the correct treatment of a Poissonian shot noise contribution. Our high resolution results represent remarkably well the cosmic web structure of the cosmic density field. Filaments, voids and clusters are clearly visible. Further, we also conduct a dynamical web classification, and estimated the web type posterior distribution conditional on the SDSS data.},

We use a large sample of ~1200 field and cluster galaxies and a sub-sample of cluster core galaxies, and quantify the significance of any putative environmental dependence on the stellar-mass-size relation. For elliptical, lenticular and high-mass (logM*/Msolar > 10) spiral galaxies we find no evidence to suggest any such environmental dependence, implying that internal drivers are governing their size evolution. For intermediate-/low-mass spirals (logM*/Msolar < 10) we find evidence, significant at the 2σ level, for a possible environmental dependence on galaxy sizes: the mean effective radius for lower mass spirals is ~15-20 per cent larger in the field than in the cluster. This is due to a population of low-mass large-ae field spirals that are largely absent from the cluster environments. These large-ae field spirals contain extended stellar discs not present in their cluster counterparts. This suggests that the fragile extended stellar discs of these spiral galaxies may not survive the environmental conditions in the cluster. Our results suggest that internal physical processes are the main drivers governing the size evolution of galaxies, with the environment possibly playing a role affecting only the discs of intermediate-/low-mass spirals.},

abstract = {Dark energy may be the first sign of new fundamental physics in the Universe, taking either a physical form or revealing a correction to Einsteinian gravity. Weak gravitational lensing and galaxy peculiar velocities provide complementary probes of general relativity, and in combination allow us to test modified theories of gravity in a unique way. We perform such an analysis by combining measurements of cosmic shear tomography from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) with the growth of structure from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey and the Six-degree-Field Galaxy Survey, producing the strongest existing joint constraints on the metric potentials that describe general theories of gravity. For scale-independent modifications to the metric potentials which evolve linearly with the effective dark energy density, we find present-day cosmological deviations in the Newtonian potential and curvature potential from the prediction of general relativity to be ΔΨ/Ψ = 0.05 $\pm$ 0.25 and ΔΦ/Φ = -0.05 $\pm$ 0.3, respectively (68 per cent confidence limits).},

abstract = {We present a method to extract the redshift-space distortions beta parameter in configuration space with a minimal set of cosmological assumptions. We show that a novel combination of the observed monopole and quadrupole correlation functions can remove efficiently the impact of mild non-linearities and redshift errors. The method offers a series of convenient properties: it does not depend on the theoretical linear correlation function; the mean galaxy density is irrelevant; only convolutions are used; there is no explicit dependence on linear bias. A Fisher matrix analysis demontrates that errors of a few percent on beta are possible with a full-sky, 1 (Gpc/h)^3 survey centered at a redshift of unity and with negligible shot-noise. We also find a baryonic feature in the normalized quadrupole in configuration space that should complicate the extraction of the growth parameter from the linear theory asymptote. On the cases tried, this doesn't have an impact on our method.},

Our survey has two components: Hubble Space Telescope imaging with STIS and Keck spectroscopy with ESI, the goal being to classify each host galaxy into one of three broad morphological/spectral classes and hence to investigate the dependence of supernovae properties on host galaxy type over a large range in redshift. Of particular interest is the supernova Hubble diagram characterised by host galaxy class which suggests that most of the scatter arises from those occurring in late-type irregulars. Supernovae hosted by (presumed dust-free) E/S0 galaxies closely follow the adopted SCP cosmological model. Although larger datasets are required, we cannot yet find any significant difference in the light curves of distant supernovae hosted in different galaxy types.},

We show using numerical simulations that the pairwise velocity PDF is strongly non-Gaussian at all scales, and explain why this is so. We caution that a commonly used ansatz to model the redshift-space power spectrum gives rise to an unphysical distribution of pairwise velocities, and show that it is in general impossible to derive the distribution from measurements of redshift-space clustering. Methods that claim to do this obtain instead something else, whose properties we derive. We provide a general derivation of the large-scale limit of the redshift-space power spectrum and show that it differs from the Kaiser formula by terms that depend on Gaussian and non-Gaussian contributions to the velocity dispersion of large-scale flows. We also show that the large-scale evolution of velocity fields is not well described by linear theory and discuss how this impacts the redshift-space power spectrum. Finally, we stress that using the monopole of the redshift-space power as an indicator of the real-space power spectrum shape can lead to systematic effects in the determination of cosmological parameters; nevertheless a simple procedure is able to recover the large-scale real-space power spectrum rather well.},

title = {Cosmology with photometric redshift surveys},
abstract = {We explore the utility of future photometric redshift imaging surveys for delineating the large-scale structure of the Universe, and assess the resulting constraints on the cosmological model. We perform the following two complementary types of analysis. (i) We quantify the statistical confidence and the accuracy with which such surveys will be able to detect and measure characteristic features in the clustering power spectrum such as the acoustic oscillations and the turnover, in a `model-independent' fashion. We show for example that a 10000-deg2 imaging survey with depth r= 22.5 and photometric redshift accuracy δz/(1 +z) = 0.03 will detect the acoustic oscillations with 99.9 per cent confidence, measuring the associated preferred cosmological scale with 2 per cent precision. Such a survey will also detect the turnover with 95 per cent confidence, determining the corresponding scale with 20 per cent accuracy. (ii) By assuming a Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model power spectrum we calculate the confidence with which a non-zero baryon fraction can be deduced from such future galaxy surveys. We quantify `wiggle detection' by calculating the number of standard deviations by which the baryon fraction is measured, after marginalizing over the shape parameter. This is typically a factor of 4 more significant (in terms of number of standard deviations) than the above `model-independent' result. For both analyses, we quantify the variation of the results with magnitude depth and photometric redshift precision, and discuss the prospects for obtaining the required performance with realistic future surveys. We conclude that the precision with which the clustering pattern may be inferred from future photometric redshift surveys will be competitive with contemporaneous spectroscopic redshift surveys, assuming that systematic effects can be controlled. We find that for equivalent wiggle detection power, a photometric redshift survey requires an area approximately 12[δz/(1 +z)]/0.03 times larger than a spectroscopic survey, for a given magnitude limit. We also note that an analysis of luminous red galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey may yield a marginal detection of acoustic oscillations in the imaging survey, in addition to that recently reported for the spectroscopic component.},

title = {Analysis of two-point statistics of cosmic shear. III. Covariances of shear measures made easy},
abstract = {Aims:In recent years cosmic shear, the weak gravitational lensing effect by the large-scale structure of the Universe, has proven to be one of the observational pillars on which the cosmological concordance model is founded. Several cosmic shear statistics have been developed in order to analyze data from surveys. For the covariances of the prevalent second-order measures we present simple and handy formulae, valid under the assumptions of Gaussian density fluctuations and a simple survey geometry. We also formulate these results in the context of shear tomography, i.e. the inclusion of redshift information, and generalize them to arbitrary data field geometries. Methods: We define estimators for the E- and B-mode projected power spectra and show them to be unbiased in the case of Gaussianity and a simple survey geometry. From the covariance of these estimators we demonstrate how to derive covariances of arbitrary combinations of second-order cosmic shear measures. We then recalculate the power spectrum covariance for general survey geometries and examine the bias thereby introduced on the estimators for exemplary configurations. Results: Our results for the covariances are considerably simpler than and analytically shown to be equivalent to the real-space approach presented in the first paper of this series. We find good agreement with other numerical evaluations and confirm the general properties of the covariance matrices. The studies of the specific survey configurations suggest that our simplified covariances may be employed for realistic survey geometries to good approximation.},

title = {A New Shear Estimator for Weak-Lensing Observations},
abstract = {We present a new shear estimator for weak-lensing observations that properly accounts for the effects of a realistic point-spread function (PSF). Images of faint galaxies are subject to gravitational shearing, followed by smearing with the instrumental and/or atmospheric PSF. We construct a ``finite-resolution shear operator,'' which when applied to an observed image has the same effect as a gravitational shear applied prior to smearing. This operator allows one to calibrate essentially any shear estimator. We then specialize to the case of weighted second-moment shear estimators. We compute the shear polarizability, which gives the response of an individual galaxy's polarization to a gravitational shear. We then compute the response of the population of galaxies, and thereby construct an optimal weighting scheme for combining shear estimates from galaxies of various shapes, luminosities, and sizes. We define a figure of merit (an inverse shear variance per unit solid angle) that characterizes the quality of image data for shear measurement. The new method is tested with simulated image data. We discuss the correction for anisotropy of the PSF and propose a new technique involving measuring shapes from images that have been convolved with a recircularizing PSF. We draw attention to a hitherto ignored noise-related bias and show how this can be analyzed and corrected for. The analysis here draws heavily on the properties of real PSFs, and we include in Appendix A a brief review, highlighting those aspects that are relevant for weak lensing.},

abstract = {We present our cosmic shear analysis of GEMS, one of the largest wide-field surveys ever undertaken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Imaged with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), GEMS spans 795 arcmin2 in the Chandra Deep Field South. We detect weak lensing by large-scale structure in high-resolution F606W GEMS data from ~60 resolved galaxies per square arcminute. We measure the two-point shear correlation function, the top-hat shear variance and the shear power spectrum, performing an E/B mode decomposition for each statistic. We show that we are not limited by systematic errors and use our results to place joint constraints on the matter density parameter Ωm and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum σ8. We find σ8(Ωm/0.3)0.65= 0.68 +/- 0.13 where the 1σ error includes both our uncertainty on the median redshift of the survey and sampling variance. Removing image and point spread function (PSF) distortions are crucial to all weak lensing analyses. We therefore include a thorough discussion on the degree of ACS PSF distortion and anisotropy which we characterize directly from GEMS data. Consecutively imaged over 20 d, GEMS data also allow us to investigate PSF instability over time. We find that, even in the relatively short GEMS observing period, the ACS PSF ellipticity varies at the level of a few per cent which we account for with a semi-time-dependent PSF model. Our correction for the temporal and spatial variability of the PSF is shown to be successful through a series of diagnostic tests.},

title = {Probing the neutrino mass hierarchy with CMB weak lensing},
abstract = {We forecast constraints on cosmological parameters with primary CMB anisotropy information and weak lensing reconstruction with a future post-Planck CMB experiment, the Cosmic Origins Explorer (COrE), using oscillation data on the neutrino mass splittings as prior information. Our MCMC simulations in flat models with a non-evolving equation-of-state of dark energy w give typical 68% upper bounds on the total neutrino mass of 0.136 eV and 0.098 eV for the inverted and normal hierarchies respectively, assuming the total summed mass is close to the minimum allowed by the oscillation data for the respective hierarchies (0.10 eV and 0.06 eV). Including information from future baryon acoustic oscillation measurements with the complete BOSS, Type 1a supernovae distance moduli from WFIRST, and a realistic prior on the Hubble constant, these upper limits shrink to 0.118 eV and 0.080 eV for the inverted and normal hierarchies, respectively. Addition of these distance priors also yields percent-level constraints on w. We find tension between our MCMC results and the results of a Fisher matrix analysis, most likely due to a strong geometric degeneracy between the total neutrino mass, the Hubble constant, and w in the unlensed CMB power spectra. If the minimal-mass, normal hierarchy were realised in nature, the inverted hierarchy should be disfavoured by the full data combination at typically greater than the 2-sigma level. For the minimal-mass inverted hierarchy, we compute the Bayes' factor between the two hierarchies for various combinations of our forecast datasets, and find that the future probes considered here should be able to provide `strong' evidence (odds ratio 12:1) for the inverted hierarchy. Finally, we consider potential biases of the other cosmological parameters from assuming the wrong hierarchy and find that all biases on the parameters are below their 1-sigma marginalised errors.},

title = {CFHTLenS tomographic weak lensing cosmological parameter constraints: Mitigating the impact of intrinsic galaxy alignments},
abstract = {We present a finely binned tomographic weak lensing analysis of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) mitigating contamination to the signal from the presence of intrinsic galaxy alignments via the simultaneous fit of a cosmological model and an intrinsic alignment model. CFHTLenS spans 154 square degrees in five optical bands, with accurate shear and photometric redshifts for a galaxy sample with a median redshift of zm = 0.70. We estimate the 21 sets of cosmic shear correlation functions associated with six redshift bins, each spanning the angular range of 1.5 < θ < 35 arcmin. We combine this CFHTLenS data with auxiliary cosmological probes: the cosmic microwave background with data from WMAP7, baryon acoustic oscillations with data from Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey and a prior on the Hubble constant from the Hubble Space Telescope distance ladder. This leads to constraints on the normalization of the matter power spectrum σ8 = 0.799 $\pm$ 0.015 and the matter density parameter Ωm = 0.271 $\pm$ 0.010 for a flat Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology. For a flat wCDM cosmology, we constrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w = -1.02 $\pm$ 0.09. We also provide constraints for curved ΛCDM and wCDM cosmologies. We find the intrinsic alignment contamination to be galaxy-type dependent with a significant intrinsic alignment signal found for early-type galaxies, in contrast to the late-type galaxy sample for which the intrinsic alignment signal is found to be consistent with zero.},

title = {How accurate is Limber's equation?},
abstract = { The so-called Limber equation is widely used in the literature to relate the projected angular clustering of galaxies to the spatial clustering of galaxies in an approximate way. This paper gives estimates of where the regime of applicability of Limber's equation stops. Limber's equation is accurate for small galaxy separations but breaks down beyond a certain separation that depends mainly on the ratio sigma/R and to some degree on the power-law index, gamma, of spatial clustering xi; sigma is the one-sigma width of the galaxy distribution in comoving distance, and R the mean comoving distance. As rule-of-thumb, a 10% relative error is reached at 260 sigma/R arcmin for gamma~1.6, if the spatial clustering is a power-law. More realistic xi are discussed in the paper. Limber's equation becomes increasingly inaccurate for larger angular separations. Ignoring this effect and blindly applying Limber's equation can possibly bias results for the inferred spatial correlation. It is suggested to use in cases of doubt, or maybe even in general, the exact equation that can easily be integrated numerically in the form given in the paper. },

title = {Tracing cosmic evolution with clusters of galaxies},
abstract = {The most successful cosmological models to date envision structure formation as a hierarchical process in which gravity is constantly drawing lumps of matter together to form increasingly larger structures. Clusters of galaxies currently sit atop this hierarchy as the largest objects that have had time to collapse under the influence of their own gravity. Thus their appearance on the cosmic scene is also relatively recent. Two features of clusters make them uniquely useful tracers of cosmic evolution. First, clusters are the biggest things whose masses we can reliably measure because they are the largest objects to have undergone gravitational relaxation and entered into virial equilibrium. Mass measurements of nearby clusters can therefore be used to determine the amount of structure in the universe on scales of 1014 1015 M⊙ , and comparisons of the present-day cluster mass distribution with the mass distribution at earlier times can be used to measure the rate of structure formation, placing important constraints on cosmological models. Second, clusters are essentially ``closed boxes'' that retain all their gaseous matter, despite the enormous energy input associated with supernovae and active galactic nuclei, because the gravitational potential wells of clusters are so deep. The baryonic component of clusters therefore contains a wealth of information about the processes associated with galaxy formation, including the efficiency with which baryons are converted into stars and the effects of the resulting feedback processes on galaxy formation. This article reviews our theoretical understanding of both the dark-matter component and the baryonic component of clusters, providing a context for interpreting the flood of new cluster observations that are now arriving from the latest generation of x-ray observatories, large optical surveys, and measurements of cluster-induced distortions in the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background.},

These include APERTIF (The Netherlands), ASKAP (Australia), eMERLIN (UK), VLA (USA), e-EVN (based in Europe), LOFAR (The Netherlands), Meerkat (South Africa), and the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). Each of these new instruments has different strengths, and coordination of surveys between them can help maximise the science from each of them. A radio continuum survey is being planned on each of them with the primary science objective of understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies over cosmic time, and the cosmological parameters and large-scale structures which drive it. In pursuit of this objective, the different teams are developing a variety of new techniques, and refining existing ones. Here we describe these projects, their science goals, and the technical challenges which are being addressed to maximise the science return. },

title = {Weak Lensing with Sizes, Magnitudes and Shapes},
abstract = {Weak lensing can be observed through a number of effects on the images of distant galaxies; their shapes are sheared, their sizes and fluxes (magnitudes) are magnified and their positions on the sky are modified by the lensing field. Galaxy shapes probe the shear field whilst size, magnitude and number density probe the convergence field. Both contain cosmological information. In this paper we are concerned with the magnification of the size and magnitude of individual galaxies as a probe of cosmic convergence. We develop a Bayesian approach for inferring the convergence field from a measured size, magnitude and redshift and demonstrate that the inference on convergence requires detailed knowledge of the joint distribution of intrinsic sizes and magnitudes. We build a simple parameterised model for the size-magnitude distribution and estimate this distribution for CFHTLenS galaxies. In light of the measured distribution, we show that the typical dispersion on convergence estimation is ~0.8, compared to ~0.38 for shear. We discuss the possibility of physical systematics for magnification (similar to intrinsic alignments for shear) and compute the expected gains in the Dark Energy Figure-of-Merit (FoM) from combining magnification with shear for different scenarios regarding systematics: when accounting for intrinsic alignments but no systematics on the magnification signal, including magnification could improve the FoM by upto a factor of ~2.5, whilst when accounting for physical systematics in both shear and magnification we anticipate a gain between ~25% and ~65%. In addition to the statistical gains, the fact that cosmic shear and magnification are subject to different systematics makes magnification an attractive complement to any cosmic shear analysis.},

The point process equation is discussed, giving the general formula for the average number density of peaks. The problem of the proper conditional probability constraints appropriate to maxima are examined using a one-dimensional illustration. The average density of maxima of a general three-dimensional Gaussian field is calculated as a function of heights of the maxima, and the average density of 'upcrossing' points on density contour surfaces is computed. The number density of peaks subject to the constraint that the large-scale density field be fixed is determined and used to discuss the segregation of high peaks from the underlying mass distribution. The machinery to calculate n-point peak-peak correlation functions is determined, as are the shapes of the profiles about maxima.},

abstract = {Galaxy clusters -- in combination with CMB and BAO data -- can provide precise constraints on the sum of neutrino masses. However, these constraints depend on the calibration of the mass-observable relation. For instance, the mass calibration employed in Planck Collaboration (2011a,b) rules out the minimal 6-parameter \Lambda CDM model at 3.7\sigma, and implies a sum of neutrino masses \sum m_\nu = 0.39 \pm 0.10. By contrast, the mass calibration favored by Rozo et al. (2012b) from a self-consistent analysis of X-ray, SZ, and optical scaling relations is consistent with a minimal flat \Lambda CDM model with no massive neutrinos (1.7\sigma), and is a better fit to additional data (e.g. H0). We discuss these results in light of the recent SPT and ACT analysis, noting that the Rozo et al. (2012b) model suggests the current mild "tension" (<2\sigma) between CMB and BAO+{\$}H_0{\$} data will decrease as the uncertainties in these measurements decrease.},

abstract = {We use data from the SDSS to investigate the evolution of the large-scale galaxy bias as a function of luminosity for red galaxies. We carefully consider correlation functions of galaxies selected from both photometric and spectroscopic data, and cross-correlations between them, to obtain multiple measurements of the large-scale bias. We find, for our most robust analyses, a strong increase in bias with luminosity for the most luminous galaxies, an intermediate regime where bias does not evolve strongly over a range of two magnitudes in galaxy luminosity, and no evidence for an upturn in bias for fainter red galaxies. Previous work has found an increase in bias to low luminosities that has been widely interpreted as being caused by an increase in the satellite fraction. We can recover such an upturn in bias to faint luminosities if we push our measurements to small scales, and include galaxy clustering measurements along the line-of-sight, where we expect non-linear effects to be the strongest. The results that we expect to be most robust suggest that central galaxies dominate the observed low luminosity population of red galaxies rather than satellite galaxies in more massive haloes.},

title = {Optimising Spectroscopic and Photometric Galaxy Surveys: Same-sky Benefits for Dark Energy and Modified Gravity},
abstract = {The combination of multiple cosmological probes can produce measurements of cosmological parameters much more stringent than those possible with any individual probe. We examine the combination of two highly correlated probes of late-time structure growth: (i) weak gravitational lensing from a survey with photometric redshifts and (ii) galaxy clustering and redshift space distortions from a survey with spectroscopic redshifts. We choose generic survey designs so that our results are applicable to a range of current and future photometric redshift (e.g. KiDS, DES, HSC, Euclid) and spectroscopic redshift (e.g. DESI, 4MOST, Sumire) surveys. Combining the surveys greatly improves their power to measure both dark energy and modified gravity. An independent, non-overlapping combination sees a dark energy figure of merit more than 4 times larger than that produced by either survey alone. The powerful synergies between the surveys are strongest for modified gravity, where their constraints are orthogonal, producing a non-overlapping joint figure of merit nearly 2 orders of magnitude larger than either alone. Our projected angular power spectrum formalism makes it easy to model the cross-correlation observable when the surveys overlap on the sky, producing a joint data vector and full covariance matrix. We calculate a same-sky improvement factor, from the inclusion of these cross-correlations, relative to non-overlapping surveys. We find nearly a factor of 4 for dark energy and more than a factor of 2 for modified gravity. The exact forecast figures of merit and same-sky benefits can be radically affected by a range of forecasts assumption, which we explore methodically in a sensitivity analysis. We show that that our fiducial assumptions produce robust results which give a good average picture of the science return from combining photometric and spectroscopic surveys.},

title = {A cosmic speed-trap: a gravity-independent test of cosmic acceleration using baryon acoustic oscillations},
abstract = {We propose a new and highly model-independent test of cosmic acceleration by comparing observations of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale at low and intermediate redshifts: we derive a new inequality relating BAO observables at two distinct redshifts, which must be satisfied for any reasonable homogeneous non-accelerating model, but is violated by models similar to LambdaCDM, due to acceleration in the recent past. This test is fully independent of the theory of gravity (GR or otherwise), the Friedmann equations, CMB and supernova observations: the test assumes only the Cosmological Principle, and that the length-scale of the BAO feature is fixed in comoving coordinates. Given realistic medium-term observations from BOSS, this test is expected to exclude all homogeneous non-accelerating models at ~ 4\sigma significance, and can reach ~ 7\sigma with next-generation surveys.},

title = {Measuring the galaxy-mass and galaxy-dust correlations through magnification and reddening},
abstract = {We present a simultaneous detection of gravitational magnification and dust reddening effects due to galactic haloes and large-scale structure. The measurement is based on correlating the brightness of ~85000 quasars at z > 1 with the position of 24 million galaxies at z ~ 0.3 derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and is used to constrain the galaxy-mass and galaxy-dust correlation functions up to cosmological scales. The presence of dust is detected from 20 kpc to several Mpc, and we find its projected density to follow: Σdust ~ r-0.8p, a distribution similar to mass. On large scales, its wavelength dependence is described by RV ~= 4.9 +/- 3.2, consistent with interstellar dust. This, in turn, implies a cosmic dust density of Ωdust ~= 5 × 10-6, roughly half of which comes from dust in haloes of ~L* galaxies. We estimate the resulting opacity of the Universe for various evolutionary models and find <AV > ~ 0.03 mag up to z = 0.5. We present magnification measurements, corrected for dust extinction, from which the galaxy-mass correlation function is inferred to give the mean surface mass density profile around galaxies Σ ~ 30(θ /1 arcmin)-0.8h Msolar pc-2 up to a radius of 10 Mpc, in agreement with gravitational shear estimates.},

title = {Measurement of intrinsic alignments in galaxy ellipticities},
abstract = {We measure the alignment of galaxy ellipticities in the local Universe over a range of scales using digitized photographic data from the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey. We find for a magnitude cut of bJ<20.5, corresponding to a median galaxy redshift of z~0.1, and 2×106 galaxies, that the galaxy ellipticities exhibit a non-zero correlation over a range of scales between 1 and 100arcmin. We detect this correlation in two colours, bJ and R and, most significantly, in the cross-correlation between the two bands, which is less likely to be contaminated by systematics. In particular, we measure the variance of mean galaxy ellipticities, σ2(θ), in square angular cells on the sky as a function of cell size and find that it lies in the range, 2×10- 4>=σ2(θ)>~1×10-5 for cell side lengths of between 15<=θ<=100arcmin. Considering the low median redshift of the galaxies in the sample and hence the relatively low effective cross-section for lensing of these galaxies by the large-scale structure of the Universe, we propose that we have detected an intrinsic alignment of galaxy ellipticities. We compare our results with recent analytical and numerical predictions made for intrinsic galaxy alignment and find good agreement. We discuss the importance of these results for measuring cosmic shear from upcoming shallow surveys (e.g. the Sloan Digital Sky Survey) and we outline how these measurements could possibly be used to constrain models of galaxy formation and/or measure the mass distribution in the local Universe.},

title = {Anti-lensing: the bright side of voids},
abstract = {More than half of the volume of our Universe is occupied by cosmic voids. The lensing magnification effect from those under-dense regions is generally thought to give a small dimming contribution: objects on the far side of a void are supposed to be observed as slightly smaller than if the void were not there, which together with conservation of surface brightness implies net reduction in photons received. This is predicted by the usual weak lensing integral of the density contrast along the line of sight. We show that this standard effect is swamped by a relativistic Doppler term that is typically neglected. Contrary to the usual expectation, objects on the far side of a void are brighter than they would be otherwise. Thus the local dynamics of matter in and near the void is crucial and is only captured by the full relativistic lensing convergence. There are also significant nonlinear corrections to the relativistic linear theory, which we show actually under-predicts the effect. We use exact solutions to estimate that these can be more than 20% for deep voids. This remains an important source of systematic errors for weak lensing density reconstruction in galaxy surveys and for supernovae observations, and may be the cause of the reported extra scatter of field supernovae located on the edge of voids compared to those in clusters.},

title = {Constraints on intrinsic alignment contamination of weak lensing surveys using the MegaZ-LRG sample},
abstract = {Correlations between the intrinsic shapes of galaxies and the large-scale galaxy density field provide an important tool to investigate galaxy intrinsic alignments, which constitute the major potential astrophysical systematic in cosmological weak lensing (cosmic shear) surveys, but also yield insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies. We measure galaxy position-shape correlations in the MegaZ-LRG sample for more than 800 000 luminous red galaxies for comoving transverse separations of 0.3 < rp < 60 h-1 Mpc, making the first such measurement with a photometric redshift sample. In combination with a re-analysis of several spectroscopic SDSS samples, we constrain an intrinsic alignment model for early-type galaxies over long baselines in redshift (z ≲ 0.7) and luminosity (4 mag) with high statistical precision. We develop and test the formalism to incorporate photometric redshift scatter in the modelling of these observations. For rp > 6 h-1 Mpc, the fits to galaxy position-shape correlation functions are consistent with the scaling with rp and redshift of a revised, nonlinear version of the linear alignment model (Hirata {\&} Seljak 2004) for all samples. An extra redshift dependence ∝ (1 + z)ηother is constrained to ηother = -0.3 $\pm$ 0.8 (1σ). To obtain consistent amplitudes for all data, an additional dependence on galaxy luminosity ∝ Lβ with β=1.1+0.3-0.2 is required. The normalisation of the intrinsic alignment power spectrum is found to be (0.077 $\pm$ 0.008) ρcr-1 for galaxies at redshift 0.3 and r band magnitude of - 22 (k- and evolution-corrected to z = 0). Assuming zero intrinsic alignments for blue galaxies, we assess the bias on cosmological parameters for a tomographic CFHTLS-like lensing survey given our new constraints on the intrinsic alignment model parameter space. Both the resulting mean bias and its uncertainty are smaller than the 1σ statistical errors when using the constraints from all samples combined. The addition of MegaZ-LRG data is critical to achieving constraints this strong, reducing the uncertainty in intrinsic alignment bias on cosmological parameters by factors of three to seven.

abstract = {We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. The Planck spectra at high multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95% upper limit of r<0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N_eff=3.30+/-0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N_eff=3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive significance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data. [Abridged]},

abstract = {We present the first application of a `multiple-tracer' redshift-space distortion (RSD) analysis to an observational galaxy sample, using data from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. Our data set is an r < 19.8 magnitude-limited sample of 178 579 galaxies covering the redshift interval z < 0.5 and area 180 deg2. We obtain improvements of 10-20 per cent in measurements of the gravitational growth rate compared to a single-tracer analysis, deriving from the correlated sample variance imprinted in the distributions of the overlapping galaxy populations. We present new expressions for the covariances between the auto-power and cross-power spectra of galaxy samples that are valid for a general survey selection function and weighting scheme. We find no evidence for a systematic dependence of the measured growth rate on the galaxy tracer used, justifying the RSD modelling assumptions, and validate our results using mock catalogues from N-body simulations. For multiple tracers selected by galaxy colour, we measure normalized growth rates in two independent redshift bins fσ8(z = 0.18) = 0.36 $\pm$ 0.09 and fσ8(z = 0.38) = 0.44 $\pm$ 0.06, in agreement with standard GR gravity and other galaxy surveys at similar redshifts.},

abstract = {We present a quantitative analysis of the largest contiguous maps of projected mass density obtained from gravitational lensing shear. We use data from the 154 deg2 covered by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). Our study is the first attempt to quantitatively characterize the scientific value of lensing maps, which could serve in the future as a complementary approach to the study of the dark universe with gravitational lensing. We show that mass maps contain unique cosmological information beyond that of traditional two-point statistical analysis techniques. Using a series of numerical simulations, we first show how, reproducing the CFHTLenS observing conditions, gravitational lensing inversion provides a reliable estimate of the projected matter distribution of large-scale structure. We validate our analysis by quantifying the robustness of the maps with various statistical estimators. We then apply the same process to the CFHTLenS data. We find that the two-point correlation function of the projected mass is consistent with the cosmological analysis performed on the shear correlation function discussed in the CFHTLenS companion papers. The maps also lead to a significant measurement of the third-order moment of the projected mass, which is in agreement with analytic predictions, and to a marginal detection of the fourth-order moment. Tests for residual systematics are found to be consistent with zero for the statistical estimators we used. A new approach for the comparison of the reconstructed mass map to that predicted from the galaxy distribution reveals the existence of giant voids in the dark matter maps as large as 3$\,^{\circ}$ on the sky. Our analysis shows that lensing mass maps are not only consistent with the results obtained by the traditional shear approach, but they also appear promising for new techniques such as peak statistics and the morphological analysis of the projected dark matter distribution.},

title = {Halo Models of Large Scale Structure},
abstract = {We review the formalism and applications of the halo-based description of nonlinear gravitational clustering. In this approach, all mass is associated with virialized dark matter halos; models of the number and spatial distribution of the halos, and the distribution of dark matter within each halo, are used to provide estimates of how the statistical properties of large scale density and velocity fields evolve as a result of nonlinear gravitational clustering. We first describe the model, and demonstrate its accuracy by comparing its predictions with exact results from numerical simulations of nonlinear gravitational clustering. We then present several astrophysical applications of the halo model: these include models of the spatial distribution of galaxies, the nonlinear velocity, momentum and pressure fields, descriptions of weak gravitational lensing, and estimates of secondary contributions to temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.},

abstract = {We test Einstein gravity using cosmological observations of both expansion and structure growth, including the latest data from supernovae (Union2.1), CMB (WMAP7), weak lensing (CFHTLS) and peculiar velocity of galaxies (SDSS DR7). We fit modified gravity parameters of the generalized Poisson equations simultaneously with the effective equation of state for the background evolution, exploring the covariances and model dependence. The results show that general relativity is a good fit to the combined data. Using a Pad{{\'e}} approximant form for the gravity deviations accurately captures the time and scale dependence for theories like {\$}f(R){\$} and DGP gravity, and weights high and low redshift probes fairly. For current observations, cosmic growth and expansion can be fit simultaneously with little degradation in accuracy, while removing the possibility of bias from holding one aspect fixed.},

We relax these assumptions allowing spatial curvature, time-dependent effective dark energy equation of state, as well as modifications of the Poisson equation for the lensing potential, and modifications of the growth of linear matter density perturbations in alternate combinations. Using six parameters characterizing these relations, we check {\Lambda}CDM for consistency utilizing cosmic microwave background anisotropies, cross correlations thereof with high-redshift galaxies through the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, the Hubble constant, supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations distances, as well as the relation between weak gravitational lensing and galaxy flows. In all scenarios, we find consistency of the concordance model at the 95% confidence level. However, we emphasize that constraining supplementary background parameters and parametrizations of the growth of large-scale structure separately may lead to a priori exclusion of viable departures from the concordance model.},

title = {Comprehensive Two-Point Analyses of Weak Gravitational Lensing Surveys},
abstract = {We present a framework for analyzing weak gravitational lensing survey data, including lensing and source-density observables, plus spectroscopic redshift calibration data. All two-point observables are predicted in terms of parameters of a perturbed Robertson-Walker metric, making the framework independent of the models for gravity, dark energy, or galaxy properties. For Gaussian fluctuations, the two-point model determines the survey likelihood function and allows Fisher matrix forecasting. The framework includes nuisance terms for the major systematic errors: shear measurement errors, magnification bias and redshift calibration errors, intrinsic galaxy alignments, and inaccurate theoretical predictions. We propose flexible parameterizations of the many nuisance parameters related to galaxy bias and intrinsic alignment. For the first time, we can integrate many different observables and systematic errors into a single analysis. As a first application of this framework, we demonstrate that: uncertainties in power-spectrum theory cause very minor degradation to cosmological information content; nearly all useful information (excepting baryon oscillations) is extracted with ≈3 bins per decade of angular scale; and the rate at which galaxy bias varies with redshift, substantially influences the strength of cosmological inference. The framework will permit careful study of the interplay between numerous observables, systematic errors, and spectroscopic calibration data for large weak lensing surveys.},

abstract = {We measure the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) in the galaxy clustering pattern at the highest redshift achieved to date, z= 0.6, using the distribution of N= 132 509 emission-line galaxies in the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We quantify BAOs using three statistics: the galaxy correlation function, power spectrum and the band-filtered estimator introduced by Xu et al. The results are mutually consistent, corresponding to a 4.0 per cent measurement of the cosmic distance-redshift relation at z= 0.6 [in terms of the acoustic parameter 'A(z)' introduced by Eisenstein et al., we find A(z= 0.6) = 0.452 $\pm$ 0.018]. Both BAOs and power spectrum shape information contribute towards these constraints. The statistical significance of the detection of the acoustic peak in the correlation function, relative to a wiggle-free model, is 3.2σ. The ratios of our distance measurements to those obtained using BAOs in the distribution of luminous red galaxies at redshifts z= 0.2 and 0.35 are consistent with a flat Λ cold dark matter model that also provides a good fit to the pattern of observed fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation. The addition of the current WiggleZ data results in a ≈30 per cent improvement in the measurement accuracy of a constant equation of state, w, using BAO data alone. Based solely on geometric BAO distance ratios, accelerating expansion (w < -1/3) is required with a probability of 99.8 per cent, providing a consistency check of conclusions based on supernovae observations. Further improvements in cosmological constraints will result when the WiggleZ survey data set is complete.},

title = {Nonlinear structure formation in the Cubic Galileon gravity model},
abstract = {We model the linear and nonlinear growth of large scale structure in the Cubic Galileon gravity model, by running a suite of N-body cosmological simulations using the {\tt ECOSMOG} code. Our simulations include the Vainshtein screening effect, which reconciles the Cubic Galileon model with local tests of gravity. In the linear regime, the amplitude of the matter power spectrum increases by {\$}\sim 25%{\$} with respect to the standard {\$}\Lambda{\$}CDM model today. The modified expansion rate accounts for {\$}\sim 20%{\$} of this enhancement, while the fifth force is responsible for only {\$}\sim 5%{\$}. This is because the effective unscreened gravitational strength deviates from standard gravity only at late times, even though it can be twice as large today. In the nonlinear regime ({\$}k \gtrsim 0.1 h\rm{Mpc}^{-1}{\$}), the fifth force leads to only a modest increase ({\$}\lesssim 8%{\$}) in the clustering power on all scales due to the very efficient operation of the Vainshtein mechanism. Such a strong effect is typically not seen in other models with the same screening mechanism. The screening also results in the fifth force increasing the number density of halos by less than 10%, on all mass scales. Our results show that the screening does not ruin the validity of linear theory on large scales which anticipates very strong constraints from galaxy clustering data. We also show that, whilst the model gives an excellent match to CMB data on small angular scales ({\$}l \gtrsim 50{\$}), the predicted integrated Sachs-Wolf effect is in tension with Planck/WMAP results.},

abstract = {We present a joint shear-and-magnification weak-lensing analysis of a sample of 16 X-ray-regular and 4 high-magnification galaxy clusters at 0.19<z<0.69 selected from the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). Our analysis uses wide-field multi-color imaging, taken primarily with Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. From a stacked shear-only analysis of the X-ray-selected subsample, we detect the ensemble-averaged lensing signal with a total signal-to-noise ratio of ~25 in the radial range of 200 to 3500kpc/h. The stacked tangential-shear signal is well described by a family of standard density profiles predicted for dark-matter-dominated halos in gravitational equilibrium, namely the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), truncated variants of NFW, and Einasto models. For the NFW model, we measure a mean concentration of {\$}c_{200c}=4.01^{+0.35}_{-0.32}{\$} at {\$}M_{200c}=1.34^{+0.10}_{-0.09} 10^{15}M_{{\o}dot}{\$}. We show this is in excellent agreement with Lambda cold-dark-matter (LCDM) predictions when the CLASH X-ray selection function and projection effects are taken into account. The best-fit Einasto shape parameter is {\$}\alpha_E=0.191^{+0.071}_{-0.068}{\$}, which is consistent with the NFW-equivalent Einasto parameter of {\$}\sim 0.18{\$}. We reconstruct projected mass density profiles of all CLASH clusters from a joint likelihood analysis of shear-and-magnification data, and measure cluster masses at several characteristic radii assuming an NFW density profile. We also derive an ensemble-averaged total projected mass profile of the X-ray-selected subsample by stacking their individual mass profiles. The stacked total mass profile, constrained by the shear+magnification data, is shown to be consistent with our shear-based halo-model predictions including the effects of surrounding large-scale structure as a two-halo term, establishing further consistency in the context of the LCDM model.},

We derive constraints on the fraction of massive neutrinos of fν < 0.049 (95 per cent CL), implying a limit of {\Sigma}mν < 0.51 eV. We find no signature of a deviation from a cosmological constant from the combination of all data sets, with a constraint of wDE = -1.033 $\pm$ 0.073 when this parameter is assumed time-independent, and no evidence of a departure from this value when it is allowed to evolve as wDE(a) = w0 + wa(1 - a).

title = {Is Cosmology Solved? An Astrophysical Cosmologist's Viewpoint},
abstract = {ABSTRACT We have fossil evidence from the thermal background radiation that our universe expanded from a considerably hotter denser state. We have a well‐defined, testable, and so far quite successful theoretical description of the expansion: the relativistic Friedmann‐Lema{\^\i}tre cosmological model. The observational successes of this model are impressive but I think hardly enough for a convincing scientific case. One way to see the limitations is to compare the lists of observational constraints and free hypotheses within the model; they have similar lengths. Another way to assess the state of the cosmological tests is to consider the search for concordant measures of the mass density parameter and the cosmological constant. The score card shows that the high‐density Einstein--de Sitter model is seriously challenged, but that there is not much to choose between the grades for low mass density models with and without a cosmological constant. That is, it is hard to argue that the Friedmann‐Lema{\^\i}tre model is strongly overconstrained, the usual criterion for a mature theory. Work in progress will significantly improve the situation and may at last yield a compelling test. If so, and the Friedmann‐Lema{\^\i}tre model survives, it will close one line of research in cosmology: we will know the outlines of what happened as our universe expanded and cooled from high density. It will not end research, of course; some of us will occupy ourselves with the details of how galaxies and other large‐scale structures came to be the way they are, others with the issue of what our universe was doing before it was expanding. The former is being driven by rapid observational advances. The latter is being driven mainly by theory, but there are hints of observational guidance.},

abstract = {We conduct a joint X-ray and weak-lensing study of four relaxed galaxy clusters (Hydra A, A478, A1689 and A1835) observed by both Suzaku and Subaru out to virial radii, with an aim to understand recently-discovered unexpected feature of the ICM in cluster outskirts. We show that the average hydrostatic-to-lensing total mass ratio for the four clusters decreases from \sim 70% to \sim 40% as the overdensity contrast decreases from 500 to the virial value.The average gas mass fraction from lensing total mass estimates increases with cluster radius and agrees with the cosmic mean baryon fraction within the virial radius, whereas the X-ray-based gas fraction considerably exceeds the cosmic values due to underestimation of the hydrostatic mass. We also develop a new advanced method for determining normalized cluster radial profiles for multiple X-ray observables by simultaneously taking into account both their radial dependence and multivariate scaling relations with weak-lensing masses. Although the four clusters span a range of halo mass, concentration, X-ray luminosity and redshift, we find that the gas entropy, pressure, temperature and density profiles are all remarkably self-similar when scaled with the lensing M_200 mass and r_200 radius.The entropy monotonically increases out to \sim 0.5r_200 following the accretion shock heating model K(r)\propto r^1.1, and flattens at \simgt 0.5r_200.The universality of the scaled entropy profiles indicates that the thermalization mechanism over the entire cluster region (>0.1r_200) is controlled by gravitation in a common to all clusters, although the heating efficiency in the outskirts needs to be modified from the standard law.The bivariate scaling functions of the gas density and temperature reveal that the flattening of the outskirts entropy profile is caused by the steepening of the temperature, rather than the flattening of the gas density.},

title = {Results of the GREAT08 Challenge: an image analysis competition for cosmological lensing},
abstract = {We present the results of the Gravitational LEnsing Accuracy Testing 2008 (GREAT08) Challenge, a blind analysis challenge to infer weak gravitational lensing shear distortions from images. The primary goal was to stimulate new ideas by presenting the problem to researchers outside the shear measurement community. Six GREAT08 Team methods were presented at the launch of the Challenge and five additional groups submitted results during the 6-month competition. Participants analyzed 30 million simulated galaxies with a range in signal-to-noise ratio, point spread function ellipticity, galaxy size and galaxy type. The large quantity of simulations allowed shear measurement methods to be assessed at a level of accuracy suitable for currently planned future cosmic shear observations for the first time. Different methods perform well in different parts of simulation parameter space and come close to the target level of accuracy in several of these. A number of fresh ideas have emerged as a result of the Challenge including a re-examination of the process of combining information from different galaxies, which reduces the dependence on realistic galaxy modelling. The image simulations will become increasingly sophisticated in future GREAT Challenges, meanwhile the GREAT08 simulations remain as a benchmark for additional developments in shear measurement algorithms. http://www.great08challenge.info E-mail: sarah.bridle@ucl.ac.uk Re-use of this article is permitted in accordance with the Terms and Conditions set out at http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/authorresources/onlineopen.html},

title = {Magnification Effects as Measures of Large-Scale Structure},
abstract = {The magnification effects of clustered matter produce variations in the image sizes and number densities of galaxies across the sky. This Letter advocates the use of these effects in wide-field surveys to map large-scale structure and the profiles of galaxy- and cluster-sized halos. The magnitude of the size variation as a function of angular scale is computed, and the signal-to-noise ratio is estimated for different survey parameters. Forthcoming surveys, especially well-designed space-based imaging surveys, will have high signal-to-noise ratios on scales of about 0.1′ to several degrees. Thus, the clustering of matter could be measured on spatial scales of about 50 kpc-100 Mpc. The signal-to-noise ratio is dominated by sample variance rather than shot noise because of the finite number density of galaxies; hence, the accuracy of the measurements will be limited primarily by survey area, sampling strategy, and possible systematics. Methods based on magnification are compared with the use of shape distortions, and the contrasts and complementaries are discussed. Future work, which is needed to plan survey strategy and interpret measurements based on magnification, is outlined.},

The magnitude of neglected terms in the generalized lens equation is estimated to be smaller than or equal to 15 Pi/4 (m/d')^2, where m is the Schwarzschild radius of massive body and d' is Chandrasekhar's impact parameter. The main applications of this generalized lens equation are extreme astrometrical configurations, where 'Standard post-Newtonian approach' as well as 'Classical lens equation' cannot be applied. It is shown that in the appropriate limits the proposed lens equation yields the known post-Newtonian terms, 'enhanced' post-post-Newtonian terms and the Classical lens equation, thus provides a link between these both essential approaches for determining the light deflection.},

title = {Planck 2013 results. XX. Cosmology from Sunyaev--Zeldovich cluster counts},
abstract = {We present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as a function of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the Planck SZ (PSZ) catalogue. The PSZ is selected through the signature of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect, and the sub-sample used here has a signal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster and all but one with a redshift estimate. We discuss the completeness of the sample and our construction of a likelihood analysis. Using a relation between mass M and SZ signal Y calibrated to X-ray measurements, we derive constraints on the power spectrum amplitude σ8 and matter density parameter Ωm in a flat ΛCDM model. We test the robustness of our estimates and find that possible biases in the Y--M relation and the halo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from the cluster sample. Assuming the X-ray determined mass to be biased low relative to the true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observed mass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we find that σ8 = 0.75 $\pm$ 0.03, Ωm = 0.29 $\pm$ 0.02, and σ8(Ωm/ 0.27)0.3 = 0.764 $\pm$ 0.025. The value of σ8 is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a value of 20% (the central value from numerical simulations) we find σ8(Ωm/0.27)0.3 = 0.78 $\pm$ 0.01 and a tighter one-dimensional range σ8 = 0.77 $\pm$ 0.02. We find that the larger values of σ8 and Ωm preferred by Planck's measurements of the primary CMB anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass bias of about 40%. Alternatively, consistency with the primary CMB constraints can be achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scales relative to the ΛCDM model, such as a component of massive neutrinos. We place our results in the context of other determinations of cosmologicalparameters, and discuss issues that need to be resolved in order to make further progress in this field.},

I provide in Section 2 a short introduction to the basics of cosmic structure formation. In Section 3 I describe the Press-Schechter (PS) formalism to derive the cosmological mass function, then discussing extensions of the PS approach and the most recent calibrations from N-body simulations. In Section 4 I review the methods to build samples of galaxy clusters at different wavelengths. Section 5 is devoted to the discussion of different methods to derive cluster masses. In Section 6 I describe the cosmological constraints, which have been obtained so far by tracing the cluster mass function with a variety of methods. Finally, I describe in Section 7 the future perspectives for cosmology with galaxy clusters and the challenges for clusters to keep playing an important role in the era of precision cosmology.},

title = {The cluster gas mass fraction as a cosmological probe: a revised study},
abstract = {Context: We present the analysis of the baryonic content of 52 X-ray luminous galaxy clusters observed with Chandra in the redshift range 0.3-1.273. Aims: Our study aims at resolving the gas mass fraction in these objects to place constraints on the cosmological parameters Ω_m, ΩΛ and the ratio between the pressure and density of the dark energy, w. Methods: We deproject the X-ray surface brightness profiles to recover the gas mass profiles and fit a single thermal component to the spectrum extracted from a region around the cluster that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratios in the observation. The measured values of the gas temperature are used to evaluate the temperature profile with a given functional form and to estimate the total gravitating mass in combination with the gas density profiles. These measured quantities are then used to statistically estimate the gas fraction and the fraction of mass in stars. By assuming that galaxy clusters are representative of the cosmic baryon budget, the distribution of the cluster baryon fraction in the hottest (T_gas > 4 keV) systems as a function of redshift is used to constrain the cosmological parameters. We discuss how our constraints are affected by several systematic effects, namely the isothermality, the assumed baryon fraction in stars, the depletion parameter and the sample selection. Results: By using only the cluster baryon fraction as a proxy for the cosmological parameters, we obtain that Ωm is very well constrained at the value of 0.35 with a relative statistical uncertainty of 11% (1σ level; w=-1) and a further systematic error of about (-6,+7)%. On the other hand, constraints on ΩΛ (without the prior of flat geometry) and w (using the prior of flat geometry) are definitely weaker due to the presence of greater statistical and systematic uncertainties (of the order of 40 per cent on ΩΛ and greater than 50 per cent on w). If the WMAP 5-year best-fit results are assumed to fix the cosmological parameters, we limit the contributions expected from non-thermal pressure support and ICM clumpiness to be lower than about 10 per cent, also leaving room to accommodate baryons not accounted for either in the X-ray emitting plasma or in stars of the order of 18 per cent of the total cluster baryon budget. This value is lowered to zero for a no-flat Universe with ΩΛ>0.7. Appendix A is only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

title = {Detection of Cosmic Magnification with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey},
abstract = {We present an 8 σ detection of cosmic magnification measured by the variation of quasar density due to gravitational lensing by foreground large-scale structure. To make this measurement we used 3800 deg2 of photometric observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) containing ~200,000 quasars and 13 million galaxies. Our measurement of the galaxy-quasar cross-correlation function exhibits the amplitude, angular dependence, and change in sign as a function of the slope of the observed quasar number counts that is expected from magnification bias due to weak gravitational lensing. We show that observational uncertainties (stellar contamination, Galactic dust extinction, seeing variations, and errors in the photometric redshifts) are well controlled and do not significantly affect the lensing signal. By weighting the quasars with the number count slope, we combine the cross-correlation of quasars for our full magnitude range and detect the lensing signal at >4 σ in all five SDSS filters. Our measurements of cosmic magnification probe scales ranging from 60 h-1 kpc to 10 h-1 Mpc and are in good agreement with theoretical predictions based on the WMAP concordance cosmology. As with galaxy-galaxy lensing, future measurements of cosmic magnification will provide useful constraints on the galaxy-mass power spectrum.},

abstract = {We report measurements of the mass density, Omega_M, and cosmological-constant energy density, Omega_Lambda, of the universe based on the analysis of 42 type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these supernovae, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fitted jointly with a set of supernovae from the Cal{\'a}n/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All supernova peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia light-curve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8Omega_M-0.6Omega_Lambda~-0.2+/-0.1 in the region of interest (Omega_M<~1.5). For a flat (Omega_M+Omega_Lambda=1) cosmology we find Omega^flat_M=0.28^+0.09_-0.08 (1 sigma statistical) ^+0.05_-0.04 (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Lambda=0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Lambda=0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero and positive, with a confidence of P(Lambda>0)=99%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is t^flat_0=14.9^+1.4_-1.1(0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Cal{\'a}n/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. Excluding those few supernovae that are outliers in color excess or fit residual does not significantly change the results. The conclusions are also robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the supernova peak magnitudes. We discuss and constrain, where possible, hypothetical alternatives to a cosmological constant.},

title = {Using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements to correct the Finger-of-God},
abstract = {For decades, cosmologists have been using galaxies to trace the large-scale distribution of matter. At present, the largest source of systematic uncertainty in this analysis is the challenge of modeling the complex relationship between galaxy redshift and the distribution of dark matter. If all galaxies sat in the centers of halos, there would be minimal Finger-of-God (FoG) effects and a simple relationship between the galaxy and matter distributions. However, many galaxies, even some of the luminous red galaxies (LRGs), do not lie in the centers of halos. Because the galaxy-galaxy lensing is also sensitive to the off-centered galaxies, we show that we can use the lensing measurements to determine the amplitude of this effect and to determine the expected amplitude of FoG effects. We develop an approach for using the lensing data to model how the FoG suppresses the power spectrum amplitudes and show that the current data implies a 30% suppression at wavenumber k=0.2h/Mpc. Our analysis implies that it is important to complement a spectroscopic survey with an imaging survey with sufficient depth and wide field coverage. Joint imaging and spectroscopic surveys allow a robust, unbiased use of the power spectrum amplitude information: it improves the marginalized error of growth rate fg=dln D/dln a by up to a factor of 2 over a wide range of redshifts z<1.4. We also find that the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, w0, and the neutrino mass, fnu, can be unbiasedly constrained by combining the lensing information, with an improvement of 10-25% compared to a spectroscopic survey without lensing calibration.},

title = {Magnification effect on the detection of primordial non-Gaussianity from photometric surveys},
abstract = {We present forecast results for constraining the primordial non-Gaussianity from photometric surveys through a large-scale enhancement of the galaxy clustering amplitude. In photometric surveys, the distribution of observed galaxies at high redshifts suffers from the gravitational-lensing magnification, which systematically alters the number density for magnitude-limited galaxy samples. We estimate size of the systematic bias in the best-fit cosmological parameters caused by the magnification effect, particularly focusing on the primordial non-Gaussianity. For upcoming deep and/or wide photometric surveys like HSC, DES and LSST, the best-fit value of the non-Gaussian parameter, fNL, obtained from the galaxy count data is highly biased, and the true values of fNL would typically go outside the 3-sigma error of the biased confidence region, if we ignore the magnification effect in the theoretical template of angular power spectrum. The additional information from cosmic shear data helps not only to improve the constraint, but also to reduce the systematic bias. As a result, the size of systematic bias on fNL would become small enough compared to the expected 1-sigma error for HSC and DES, but it would be still serious for deep surveys with z_m > 1.5, like LSST. Tomographic technique improves the constraint on fNL by a factor of 2-3 compared to the one without tomography, but the systematic bias would increase.},

abstract = {In a recent paper (Brown {\&} Battye 2011), we proposed the use of integrated polarization measurements of background galaxies in radio weak gravitational lensing surveys and investigated the potential impact on the statistical measurement of cosmic shear. Here we extend this idea to reconstruct maps of the projected dark matter distribution, or lensing convergence field. The addition of polarization can, in principle, greatly reduce shape noise due to the intrinsic dispersion in galaxy ellipticities. We show that maps reconstructed using this technique in the radio band can be competitive with those derived using standard lensing techniques which make use of many more galaxies. In addition, since the reconstruction noise is uncorrelated between these standard techniques and the polarization technique, their comparison can serve as a powerful check for systematics and their combination can reduce noise further. We examine the convergence reconstruction which could be achieved with two forthcoming facilities: (i) a deep survey, covering 1.75 square degrees using the e-MERLIN instrument currently being commissioned in the UK and (ii) the high resolution, deep wide field surveys which will eventually be conducted with the Square Kilometre Array.},

title = {Magnificent Magnification: Exploiting the Other Half of the Lensing Signal},
abstract = {We describe a new method for measuring galaxy magnification due to weak gravitational lensing. Our method makes use of a tight scaling relation between galaxy properties that are modified by gravitational lensing, such as apparent size, and other properties that are not, such as surface brightness. In particular, we use a version of the well-known fundamental plane relation for early type galaxies. This modified "photometric fundamental plane" replaces velocity dispersions with photometric galaxy properties, thus obviating the need for spectroscopic data. We present the first detection of magnification using this method by applying it to photometric catalogs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This analysis shows that the derived magnification signal is comparable to that available from conventional methods using gravitational shear. We suppress the dominant sources of systematic error and discuss modest improvements that may allow this method to equal or even surpass the signal-to-noise achievable with shear. Moreover, some of the dominant sources of systematic error are substantially different from those of shear-based techniques. Thus, combining the two techniques addresses the major weaknesses of each and provides a substantial improvement over either method used in isolation. With this new technique, magnification becomes a necessary measurement tool for the coming era of large ground-based surveys intending to measure gravitational lensing.},

We quantify the importance of these properties of the galaxy distribution by randomizing the angular positions of satellite galaxies within haloes, either coherently or individually, while keeping the distance to their respective central galaxies fixed. We find that the effect of disrupting the alignment with larger-scale structure is a ~2 per cent decrease in the galaxy correlation function around r=1.8 Mpc/h. Sphericalizing the ellipsoidal distributions of galaxies within haloes decreases the correlation function by up to 20 per cent for r<1 Mpc/h. Similar results apply to power spectra and redshift-space correlation functions. Models such as those based on the Halo Occupation Distribution, which adopt a spherically averaged profile for the galaxy distributions within haloes, will therefore significantly underestimate the clustering on sub-Mpc scales.},

Our aim is to quantify the scatter, systematic bias and completeness of cluster masses derived from a diverse set of 25 galaxy-based methods using two contrasting mock galaxy catalogues based on a sophisticated halo occupation model and a semi-analytic model. Analysing 968 clusters, we find a wide range in the RMS errors in log M200c delivered by the different methods (0.18 to 1.08 dex, i.e., a factor of ~1.5 to 12), with abundance matching and richness methods providing the best results, irrespective of the input model assumptions. In addition, certain methods produce a significant number of catastrophic cases where the mass is under- or over-estimated by a factor greater than 10. Given the steeply falling high-mass end of the cluster mass function, we recommend that richness or abundance matching-based methods are used in conjunction with these methods as a sanity check for studies selecting high mass clusters. We see a stronger correlation of the recovered to input number of galaxies for both catalogues in comparison with the group/cluster mass, however, this does not guarantee that the correct member galaxies are being selected. We do not observe significantly higher scatter for either mock galaxy catalogues. Our results have implications for cosmological analyses that utilise the masses, richnesses, or abundances of clusters, which have different uncertainties when different methods are used.},

title = {Dark energy constraints from cosmic shear power spectra: impact of intrinsic alignments on photometric redshift requirements},
abstract = {Cosmic shear constrains cosmology by exploiting the apparent alignments of pairs of galaxies due to gravitational lensing by intervening mass clumps. However, galaxies may become (intrinsically) aligned with each other, and with nearby mass clumps, during their formation. This effect needs to be disentangled from the cosmic shear signal to place constraints on cosmology. We use the linear intrinsic alignment model as a base and compare it to an alternative model and data. If intrinsic alignments are ignored then the dark energy equation of state is biased by ~50%. We examine how the number of tomographic redshift bins affects uncertainties on cosmological parameters and find that when intrinsic alignments are included two or more times as many bins are required to obtain 80% of the available information. We investigate how the degradation in the dark energy figure of merit depends on the photometric redshift scatter. Previous studies have shown that lensing does not place stringent requirements on the photometric redshift uncertainty, so long as the uncertainty is well known. However, if intrinsic alignments are included the requirements become a factor of three tighter. These results are quite insensitive to the fraction of catastrophic outliers, assuming that this fraction is well known. We show the effect of uncertainties in photometric redshift bias and scatter. Finally, we quantify how priors on the intrinsic alignment model would improve dark energy constraints.},

abstract = {Constraints on cosmology from recent cosmic shear observations are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their treatment of potential systematic effects. Here we present cosmological constraints which include modelling of intrinsic alignments. We demonstrate how the results are changed for three different intrinsic alignment models, and for two different models of the cosmic shear galaxy population. We find that intrinsic alignments can either reduce or increase measurements of the fluctuation amplitude parameter σ8 depending on these decisions, and depending on the cosmic shear survey properties. This is due to the interplay between the two types of intrinsic alignment, intrinsic-intrinsic (II) and gravitational-intrinsic (GI). It has been shown that future surveys must make a careful treatment of intrinsic alignments to avoid significant biases, and that simultaneous constraints from shear-shear and shear-position correlation functions can mitigate the effects. For the first time we here combine constraints from cosmic shear surveys (shear-shear correlations) with those from `GI' intrinsic alignment data sets (shear-position correlations). We produce updated constraints on cosmology marginalized over two free parameters in the halo model for intrinsic alignments. We find that the additional freedom is well compensated by the additional information, in that the constraints are very similar indeed to those obtained when intrinsic alignments are ignored, in terms of both best-fitting values and uncertainties.},

title = {Cluster Lensing Profiles Derived from a Redshift Enhancement of Magnified BOSS-Survey Galaxies},
abstract = {We report the first detection of a redshift-depth enhancement of background galaxies magnified by foreground clusters. Using 300,000 BOSS-Survey galaxies with accurate spectroscopic redshifts, we measure their mean redshift depth behind four large samples of optically selected clusters from the SDSS surveys, totalling 5,000-15,000 clusters. A clear trend of increasing mean redshift towards the cluster centers is found, averaged over each of the four cluster samples. In addition we find similar but noisier behaviour for an independent X-ray sample of 158 clusters lying in the foreground of the current BOSS sky area. By adopting the mass-richness relationships appropriate for each survey we compare our results with theoretical predictions for each of the four SDSS cluster catalogs. The radial form of this redshift enhancement is well fitted by a richness-to-mass weighted composite Navarro-Frenk-White profile with an effective mass ranging between M_200 ~ 1.4-1.8 10^14 M_sun for the optically detected cluster samples, and M_200 ~ 5.0 10^14 M_sun for the X-ray sample. This lensing detection helps to establish the credibility of these SDSS cluster surveys, and provides a normalization for their respective mass-richness relations. In the context of the upcoming bigBOSS, Subaru-PFS, and EUCLID-NISP spectroscopic surveys, this method represents an independent means of deriving the masses of cluster samples for examining the cosmological evolution, and provides a relatively clean consistency check of weak-lensing measurements, free from the systematic limitations of shear calibration.},

abstract = {We interpret and model the statistical weak lensing measurements around 130,000 groups and clusters of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey presented by Sheldon et al. 2007 (Paper I). We present non-parametric inversions of the 2D shear profiles to the mean 3D cluster density and mass profiles in bins of both optical richness and cluster i-band luminosity. We correct the inferred 3D profiles for systematic effects, including non-linear shear and the fact that cluster halos are not all precisely centered on their brightest galaxies. We also model the measured cluster shear profile as a sum of contributions from the brightest central galaxy, the cluster dark matter halo, and neighboring halos. We infer the relations between mean cluster virial mass and optical richness and luminosity over two orders of magnitude in cluster mass; the virial mass at fixed richness or luminosity is determined with a precision of 13% including both statistical and systematic errors. We also constrain the halo concentration parameter and halo bias as a function of cluster mass; both are in good agreement with predictions of LCDM models. The methods employed here will be applicable to deeper, wide-area optical surveys that aim to constrain the nature of the dark energy, such as the Dark Energy Survey, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and space-based surveys.},

abstract = {We investigate the cosmological implications of the latest growth of structure measurements from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS Data Release 11 with particular focus on the sum of the neutrino masses, {\$}\sum m_{\nu}{\$}. We examine the robustness of the cosmological constraints from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale, the Alcock-Paczynski effect and redshift-space distortions ({\$}D_V/r_s{\$}, {\$}F_{\rm AP}{\$}, {\$}f\sigma_8{\$}) of~\citet{Beutler:2013b}, when introducing a neutrino mass in the power spectrum template. Any shift in the CMASS constraints is below {\$}0.5\sigma{\$} when changing {\$}\sum m_{\nu}{\$} from {\$}0\,{\$}eV to {\$}0.4\,{\$}eV, which roughly represents the currently allowed range for this parameter. We then discuss how the neutrino mass relaxes discrepancies between the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and other low-redshift measurements within {\$}\Lambda{\$}CDM. Combining our cosmological constraints with WMAP9 yields {\$}\sum m_{\nu} = 0.36\pm0.14\,{\$}eV, which represents a {\$}2.6\sigma{\$} preference for neutrino mass. The significance can be increased to {\$}3.3\sigma{\$} when including weak lensing results and other BAO constraints, yielding {\$}\sum m_{\nu} = 0.35\pm0.10\,{\$}eV. However, combining CMASS with Planck data reduces the preference for neutrino mass to {\$}\sim 2\sigma{\$}. When removing the CMB lensing effect in the Planck temperature power spectrum (by marginalising over {\$}A_{\rm L}{\$}), we see shifts of {\$}\sim 1\sigma{\$} in {\$}\sigma_8{\$} and {\$}{\O}mega_m{\$}, which have a significant effect on the neutrino mass constraints. In case of CMASS plus Planck without the {\$}A_{\rm L}{\$}-lensing signal, we find a preference for a neutrino mass of {\$}\sum m_{\nu} = 0.34\pm 0.14\,{\$}eV, in excellent agreement with the WMAP9+CMASS value. The constraint can be tightened to {\$}3.4\sigma{\$} yielding {\$}\sum m_{\nu} = 0.36\pm 0.10\,{\$}eV when weak lensing data and other BAO constraints are included.},

title = {Constraining dark matter halo properties using lensed Supernova Legacy Survey supernovae},
abstract = {This paper exploits the gravitational magnification of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to measure properties of dark matter haloes. Gravitationally magnified and de-magnified SNe Ia should be brighter and fainter than average, respectively. The magnification of individual SNe Ia can be computed using observed properties of foreground galaxies and dark matter halo models. We model the dark matter haloes of the galaxies as truncated singular isothermal spheres with velocity dispersion and truncation radius obeying luminosity-dependent scaling laws. A homogeneously selected sample of 175 SNe Ia from the first 3yr of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) in the redshift range 0.2 <~ z <~ 1 is used to constrain models of the dark matter haloes associated with foreground galaxies. The best-fitting velocity dispersion scaling law agrees well with galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. We further find that the normalization of the velocity dispersion of passive and star-forming galaxies are consistent with empirical Faber-Jackson and Tully-Fisher relations, respectively. If we make no assumption on the normalization of these relations, we find that the data prefer gravitational lensing at the 92 per cent confidence level. Using recent models of dust extinction, we deduce that the impact of this effect on our results is very small. We also investigate the brightness scatter of SNe Ia due to gravitational lensing, which has implications for SN Ia cosmology. The gravitational lensing scatter is approximately proportional to the SN Ia redshift. We find the constant of proportionality to be B ~= 0.055+0.039-0.041mag (B <~ 0.12mag at the 95 per cent confidence level). If this model is correct, the contribution from lensing to the intrinsic brightness scatter of SNe Ia is small for the SNLS sample. According to the best-fitting dark matter model, gravitational lensing should, however, contribute significantly to the brightness scatter at z >~ 1.6.},

title = {Weak Lensing by Large-Scale Structure and the Polarization Properties of Distant Radio Sources},
abstract = {We estimate the effects of weak lensing by large-scale density inhomogeneities and long-wavelength gravitational waves on the polarization properties of electromagnetic radiation as it propagates from cosmologically distant sources. Scalar (density) fluctuations do not rotate either the plane of polarization of the electromagnetic radiation or the source image. They do, however, produce an appreciable shear that distorts the image shape, leading to an apparent rotation of the image orientation relative to its plane of polarization. In sources with large ellipticity, the apparent rotation is rather small, of the order (in radians) of the dimensionless shear. The effect is larger at smaller source eccentricities. A shear of 1% can induce apparent rotations of around 5 deg in radio sources with the smallest eccentricity among those with a significant degree of integrated linear polarization. We discuss the possibility that weak lensing by shear with an rms value around or below 5% may be the cause for the dispersion in the direction of integrated linear polarization of cosmologically distant radio sources away from the perpendicular to their major axis, as expected from models of their magnetic fields. An rms shear larger than 5% would be incompatible with the observed correlation between polarization properties and source orientation in distant radio galaxies and quasars. Gravity waves do rotate both the plane of polarization and the source image. Their weak-lensing effects, however, are negligible.},

abstract = {We study the effects on the number counts of sub-millimetre galaxies due to gravitational lensing. We explore the effects on the magnification cross section due to halo density profiles, ellipticity and cosmological parameter (the power-spectrum normalisation {\$}\sigma_8{\$}). We show that the ellipticity does not strongly affect the magnification cross section in gravitational lensing while the halo radial profiles do. Since the baryonic cooling effect is stronger in galaxies than clusters, galactic haloes are more concentrated. In light of this, a new scenario of two halo population model is explored where galaxies are modeled as a singular isothermal sphere profile and clusters as a Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) profile. We find the transition mass between the two has modest effects on the lensing probability. The cosmological parameter {\$}\sigma_8{\$} alters the abundance of haloes and therefore affects our results. Compared with other methods, our model is simpler and more realistic. The conclusions of previous works is confirm that gravitational lensing is a natural explanation for the number count excess at the bright end.},

abstract = {We measure the weak-lensing masses and galaxy distributions of four massive galaxy clusters observed during the Science Verification phase of the Dark Energy Survey with the purpose of 1) validating the DECam imager for the task of measuring weak-lensing shapes, and 2) utilizing DECam's large field of view to map out the clusters and their environments over 90 arcmin. We conduct a series of rigorous tests on astrometry, photometry, image quality, PSF modeling, and shear measurement accuracy to single out flaws in the data and also to identify the optimal data processing steps and parameters. We find Science Verification data from DECam to be suitable for lensing analyses. The PSF is generally well-behaved, but the modeling is rendered difficult by a flux-dependent PSF width. We employ photometric redshifts to distinguish between foreground and background galaxies, and a red-sequence cluster finder to provide cluster richness estimates and cluster-galaxy distributions. By fitting NFW profiles to the clusters in this study, we determine weak-lensing masses that are in agreement with previous work. For Abell 3261, we provide the first estimates of redshift, weak-lensing mass, and richness. In addition, the cluster-galaxy distributions indicate the existence of filaments attached to 1E 0657-56 and RXC J2248.7-4431, stretching out as far as 1 degree (approximately 20 Mpc), showcasing the potential of DECam and DES for detailed studies of degree-scale features on the sky.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

abstract = {Similar to the magnification of the galaxies' fluxes by gravitational lensing, the extinction of the fluxes by comic dust, whose existence is recently detected by Menard et al (2009), also modify the distribution of a flux-selected galaxy sample. We study the anisotropic distortion by dust extinction to the 3D galaxy correlation function, including magnification bias and redshift distortion at the same time. We find the extinction distortion is most significant along the line of sight and at large separations, similar to that by magnification bias. The correction from dust extinction is negative except at sufficiently large transverse separations, which is almost always opposite to that from magnification bias (we consider a number count slope s > 0.4). Hence, the distortions from these two effects tend to reduce each other. At low z (~<1), the distortion by extinction is stronger than that by magnification bias, but at high z, the reverse holds. We also study how dust extinction affects probes in real space of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the linear redshift distortion parameter beta. We find its effect on BAO is negligible. However, it introduces a positive scale-dependent correction to beta that can be as large as a few percent. At the same time, we also find a negative scale-dependent correction from magnification bias, which is up to percent level at low z, but to ~40% at high z. These corrections are non-negligible for precision cosmology, and should be considered when testing General Relativity through the scale-dependence of beta.},

The statistical power is similar to, but not quite as good as, cosmic shear, and it is subject to different systematic effects. Application to ground-based data will be challenging, with relatively large empirical corrections required to account for the fact that many galaxies are smaller than the PSF, but for space-based data with 0.1-0.2 arcsec resolution, the size distribution of galaxies brighter than i ≃ 24 is almost ideal for accurate estimation of cosmic size magnification.},

title = {Means of confusion: how pixel noise affects shear estimates for weak gravitational lensing},
abstract = {Weak-lensing shear estimates show a troublesome dependence on the apparent brightness of the galaxies used to measure the ellipticity: in several studies, the amplitude of the inferred shear falls sharply with decreasing source significance. This dependence limits the overall ability of upcoming large weak-lensing surveys to constrain cosmological parameters. We seek to provide a concise overview of the impact of pixel noise on weak-lensing measurements, covering the entire path from noisy images to shear estimates. We show that there are at least three distinct layers, where pixel noise not only obscures but also biases the outcome of the measurements: (1) the propagation of pixel noise to the non-linear observable ellipticity; (2) the response of the shape-measurement methods to limited amount of information extractable from noisy images and (3) the reaction of shear estimation statistics to the presence of noise and outliers in the measured ellipticities. We identify and discuss several fundamental problems and show that each of them is able to introduce biases in the range of a few tens to a few per cent for galaxies with typical significance levels. Furthermore, all of these biases do not only depend on the brightness of galaxies but also depend on their ellipticity, with more elliptical galaxies often being harder to measure correctly. We also discuss existing possibilities to mitigate and novel ideas to avoid the biases induced by pixel noise. We present a new shear estimator that shows a more robust performance for noisy ellipticity samples. Finally, we release the open-source PYTHON code to predict and efficiently sample from the noisy ellipticity distribution and the shear estimators used in this work at https://github.com/pmelchior/epsnoise.},

title = {Bayesian galaxy shape measurement for weak lensing surveys - I. Methodology and a fast-fitting algorithm},
abstract = {The principles of measuring the shapes of galaxies by a model-fitting approach are discussed in the context of shape measurement for surveys of weak gravitational lensing. It is argued that such an approach should be optimal, allowing measurement with maximal signal-to-noise ratio, coupled with estimation of measurement errors. The distinction between likelihood-based and Bayesian methods is discussed. Systematic biases in the Bayesian method may be evaluated as part of the fitting process, and overall such an approach should yield unbiased shear estimation without requiring external calibration from simulations. The principal disadvantage of model fitting for large surveys is the computational time required, but here an algorithm is presented that enables large surveys to be analysed in feasible computation times. The method and algorithm is tested on simulated galaxies from the Shear TEsting Programme (STEP).},

title = {The 2dF QSO Redshift Survey - X. Lensing of background QSOs by galaxy groups},
abstract = {We cross-correlate quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) from the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey with groups of galaxies. In the southern region of the 2dF we utilize galaxies from the APM Survey. In the northern strip, galaxies are taken from the recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey Early Data Release. Both galaxy samples are limited to a depth B < 20.5. We use an objective clustering algorithm to detect groups in these galaxy catalogues. A 3σ anticorrelation is observed between 2dF QSOs and galaxy groups, confirming the effect found by Boyle, Fong {\&} Shanks in an independent data set. This paucity of faint QSOs around groups cannot be readily attributed to a selection effect and is not due to restrictions on the placement of 2dF fibres. By observing the colours of QSOs on the scales of the anticorrelation, we limit the influence intervening dust in galaxy groups can have on background QSO flux, finding a maximum reddening on the scale of the anticorrelation of E(bj-r) <= 0.012 at the 95 per cent level. The small amount of dust inferred from the QSO colours would be insufficient to account for the anticorrelation, supporting the suggestion by Croom {\&} Shanks that the signal is likely to be caused by weak gravitational lensing. The possibility remains that tailored dust models involving grey dust, heavy patches of dust or a combination of dust and lensing, could explain the anticorrelation. Under the assumption that the signal is caused by lensing rather than dust, we measure the average velocity dispersion of a singular isothermal sphere that would cause the anticorrelation, finding σ~ 1150 km s-1. Simple simulations reject σ~ 600 km s-1 at the 5 per cent significance level. We also suppose that the foreground mass distribution consists of dark matter haloes with an Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile and measure the typical mass within 1.5 h-1 Mpc of the halo centre as M1.5= 1.2 +/- 0.9 × 1015h-1 Msolar. Regardless of whether we utilize a singular isothermal sphere or NFW dark matter profile, our simple lensing model favours more mass in groups of galaxies than is accounted for in a universe with density parameter Ωm= 0.3. Detailed simulations and galaxy group redshift information will significantly reduce the current systematic uncertainties in these Ωm estimates. Reducing the remaining statistical uncertainty in this result will require larger QSO and galaxy group surveys.},

abstract = {We present new weak-lensing observations of 1E 0657-558 (z=0.296), a unique cluster merger, that enable a direct detection of dark matter, independent of assumptions regarding the nature of the gravitational force law. Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray-emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground-based images and HST/ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps showing that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8 σ significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.

title = {Seven-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Cosmological Interpretation},
abstract = {The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant (H 0) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter ΛCDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is ns = 0.968 $\pm$ 0.012 (68% CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by 99.5% CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, {\Sigma}m ν < 0.58 eV(95%CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, N eff = 4.34+0.86 -0.88 (68% CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H 0. The limit on a constant dark energy equation of state parameter from WMAP+BAO+H 0, without high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, is w = -1.10 $\pm$ 0.14 (68% CL). We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring Yp = 0.326 $\pm$ 0.075 (68% CL). We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z = 1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. The seven-year polarization data have significantly improved: we now detect the temperature-E-mode polarization cross power spectrum at 21σ, compared with 13σ from the five-year data. With the seven-year temperature-B-mode cross power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved by 38% to Δ α =-1.1$\pm$ 1.4$\,^{\circ}$ statistical $\pm$ 1.5 systematic (68% CL). We report significant detections of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data on a cluster-by-cluster basis. However, it is a factor of 0.5-0.7 times the predictions from "universal profile" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope Collaboration. WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

title = {The importance of stepping up in the excursion set approach},
abstract = {Recently, we provided a simple but accurate formula which closely approximates the first crossing distribution associated with random walks having correlated steps. The approximation is accurate for the wide range of barrier shapes of current interest and is based on the requirement that, in addition to having the right height, the walk must cross the barrier going upwards. Therefore, it only requires knowledge of the bivariate distribution of the walk height and slope, and is particularly useful for excursion set models of the massive end of the halo mass function. However, it diverges at lower masses. We show how to cure this divergence by using a formulation which requires knowledge of just one other variable. While our analysis is general, we use examples based on Gaussian initial conditions to illustrate our results. Our formulation, which is simple and fast, yields excellent agreement with the considerably more computationally expensive Monte-Carlo solution of the first crossing distribution, for a wide variety of moving barriers, even at very low masses.},

abstract = {We discuss the structural and morphological properties of galaxies in a z = 1.62 proto-cluster using near-IR imaging data from Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 data of the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS). The cluster galaxies exhibit a clear color-morphology relation: galaxies with colors of quiescent stellar populations generally have morphologies consistent with spheroids, and galaxies with colors consistent with ongoing star formation have disk-like and irregular morphologies. The size distribution of the quiescent cluster galaxies shows a deficit of compact (lsim 1 kpc), massive galaxies compared to CANDELS field galaxies at z = 1.6. As a result, the cluster quiescent galaxies have larger average effective sizes compared to field galaxies at fixed mass at greater than 90% significance. Combined with data from the literature, the size evolution of quiescent cluster galaxies is relatively slow from z ~= 1.6 to the present, growing as (1 + z)-0.6 $\pm$ 0.1. If this result is generalizable, then it implies that physical processes associated with the denser cluster region seem to have caused accelerated size growth in quiescent galaxies prior to z = 1.6 and slower subsequent growth at z < 1.6 compared to galaxies in the lower density field. The quiescent cluster galaxies at z = 1.6 have higher ellipticities compared to lower redshift samples at fixed mass, and their surface-brightness profiles suggest that they contain extended stellar disks. We argue that the cluster galaxies require dissipationless (i.e., gas-poor or "dry") mergers to reorganize the disk material and to match the relations for ellipticity, stellar mass, size, and color of early-type galaxies in z < 1 clusters.},

title = {Shapelets - I. A method for image analysis},
abstract = {We present a new method for the analysis of images, a fundamental task in observational astronomy. It is based on the linear decomposition of each object in the image into a series of localized basis functions of different shapes, which we call `shapelets'. A particularly useful set of complete and orthonormal shapelets is that consisting of weighted Hermite polynomials, which correspond to perturbations around a circular Gaussian. They are also the eigenstates of the two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, and thus allow us to use the powerful formalism developed for this problem. One of their special properties is their invariance under Fourier transforms (up to a rescaling), leading to an analytic form for convolutions. The generator of linear transformations such as translations, rotations, shears and dilatations can be written as simple combinations of raising and lowering operators. We derive analytic expressions for practical quantities, such as the centroid (astrometry), flux (photometry) and radius of the object, in terms of its shapelet coefficients. We also construct polar basis functions which are eigenstates of the angular momentum operator, and thus have simple properties under rotations. As an example, we apply the method to Hubble Space Telescope images, and show that the small number of shapelet coefficients required to represent galaxy images lead to compression factors of about 40 to 90. We discuss applications of shapelets for the archival of large photometric surveys, for weak and strong gravitational lensing and for image deprojection.},

On scales outside a few virial radii, the halo bias, {\$}b{\$}, is linear and the lensing signal is dominated by the correlated distribution of matter around galaxy clusters. We discuss a method to measure the power spectrum amplitude {\$}\sigma_8{\$} and {\$}b{\$} based on a minimal modelling. We considered a sample of {\$}\sim 120000{\$} clusters photometrically selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in the redshift range {\$}0.1<z<0.6{\$}. The auto-correlation was studied through the two-point function of a subsample of {\$}\sim 70000{\$} clusters; the matter-halo correlation was derived from the weak lensing signal of the subsample of {\$}\sim 1200{\$} clusters with Canada-France-Hawaii Lensing Survey data. We obtained a direct measurement of {\$}b{\$}, which increases with mass in agreement with predictions of the {\$}\Lambda{\$}CDM paradigm. Assuming {\$}{\O}mega_\mathrm{M}=0.3{\$}, we found {\$}\sigma_8=0.78\pm0.17{\$}. We used the same clusters for measuring both lensing and clustering and the estimate of {\$}\sigma_8{\$} did require neither the mass-richness relation, nor the knowledge of the selection function, nor the modelling of {\$}b{\$}. With an additional theoretical prior on the bias, we obtained {\$}\sigma_8=0.80\pm0.10{\$}.},

abstract = {Strong gravitational lensing magnifies the flux from distant galaxies, allowing us to detect emission lines that would otherwise fall below the detection threshold for medium-resolution spectroscopy. Here we present the detection of temperature-sensitive oxygen emission lines from three galaxies at 2<z<3.5, which enables us to directly determine the oxygen abundances and thereby double the number of galaxies at z>2 for which this has been possible. The three galaxies have ~10% solar oxygen abundances in agreement with strong emission line diagnostics. Carbon and nitrogen ratios relative to oxygen are sub-solar as expected for young metal-poor galaxies. Two of the galaxies are Lya emitters with rest-frame equivalent widths of 20 A and 40 A, respectively, and their high magnification factors allow us for the first time to gain insight into the physical characteristics of high-redshift Lya emitters. Using constraints from the physical properties of the galaxies, we accurately reproduce their line profiles with radiative transfer models. The models show a relatively small outflow in agreement with the observed small velocity offsets between nebular emission and interstellar absorption lines.},

title = {Numerical study of halo concentrations in dark-energy cosmologies},
abstract = {We study the concentration parameters, their mass dependence and redshift evolution, of dark-matter halos in different dark-energy cosmologies with constant and time-variable equation of state, and compare them with ``standard'' ΛCDM and OCDM models. We find that previously proposed algorithms for predicting halo concentrations can be well adapted to dark-energy models. When centred on the analytically expected values, halo concentrations show a log-normal distribution with a uniform standard deviation of ˜0.2. The dependence of averaged halo concentrations on mass and redshift permits a simple fit of the form (1+z) c=c0 (M/M0)α, with α≈-0.1 throughout. We find that the cluster concentration depends on the dark energy equation of state at the cluster formation redshift zcoll through the linear growth factor D+(zcoll). As a simple correction accounting for dark-energy cosmologies, we propose scaling c0 from ΛCDM with the ratio of linear growth factors, c0-> c0 D+(zcoll)/D+, ΛCDM (zcoll).},

abstract = {We measure the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) in the galaxy clustering pattern at the highest redshift achieved to date, z=0.6, using the distribution of N=132,509 emission-line galaxies in the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We quantify BAOs using three statistics: the galaxy correlation function, power spectrum and the band-filtered estimator introduced by Xu et al. (2010). The results are mutually consistent, corresponding to a 4.0% measurement of the cosmic distance-redshift relation at z=0.6 (in terms of the acoustic parameter "A(z)" introduced by Eisenstein et al. (2005) we find A(z=0.6) = 0.452 +/- 0.018). Both BAOs and power spectrum shape information contribute toward these constraints. The statistical significance of the detection of the acoustic peak in the correlation function, relative to a wiggle-free model, is 3.2-sigma. The ratios of our distance measurements to those obtained using BAOs in the distribution of Luminous Red Galaxies at redshifts z=0.2 and z=0.35 are consistent with a flat Lambda Cold Dark Matter model that also provides a good fit to the pattern of observed fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. The addition of the current WiggleZ data results in a ~ 30% improvement in the measurement accuracy of a constant equation-of-state, w, using BAO data alone. Based solely on geometric BAO distance ratios, accelerating expansion (w < -1/3) is required with a probability of 99.8%, providing a consistency check of conclusions based on supernovae observations. Further improvements in cosmological constraints will result when the WiggleZ Survey dataset is complete.},

title = {On the complementarity of galaxy clustering with cosmic shear and flux magnification},
abstract = {With the wealth of forthcoming data from wide-field surveys, it is more important than ever to understand the full range of independent probes of cosmology at our disposal. Here, we explore the potential for galaxy clustering and cosmic shear, separately and in combination, including the effects of lensing magnification. We show that inferred cosmological parameters may be biased when flux magnification is neglected. Results are presented for Stage III ground-based and Stage IV space-based photometric surveys, using slopes of the luminosity function inferred from the Canada-France-Hawaii Lensing Survey catalogue. We find that combining with clustering improves the shear Dark Energy Task Force-like Figure of Merit by a factor of 1.33 using only autocorrelations in redshift for the clustering analysis, rising to 1.52 when cross-correlations are also included. The further addition of galaxy-galaxy lensing gives increases in the shear Figure of Merit by a factor of 2.82 and 3.7 for each type of clustering analysis, respectively. The presence of flux magnification in a clustering analysis does not significantly affect the precision of cosmological constraints when combined with cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing. However, if magnification is neglected, inferred cosmological parameter values are biased, with biases in some cosmological parameters larger than statistical errors.},

title = {Improved constraints on dark energy from Chandra X-ray observations of the largest relaxed galaxy clusters},
abstract = {We present constraints on the mean matter density, Ωm, dark energy density, ΩDE, and the dark energy equation of state parameter, w, using Chandra measurements of the X-ray gas mass fraction (fgas) in 42 hot (kT > 5keV), X-ray luminous, dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters spanning the redshift range 0.05 < z < 1.1. Using only the fgas data for the six lowest redshift clusters at z < 0.15, for which dark energy has a negligible effect on the measurements, we measure Ωm = 0.28 +/- 0.06 (68 per cent confidence limits, using standard priors on the Hubble constant, H0, and mean baryon density, Ωbh2). Analysing the data for all 42 clusters, employing only weak priors on H0 and Ωbh2, we obtain a similar result on Ωm and a detection of the effects of dark energy on the distances to the clusters at ~99.99 per cent confidence, with ΩDE = 0.86 +/- 0.21 for a non-flat ΛCDM model. The detection of dark energy is comparable in significance to recent type Ia supernovae (SNIa) studies and represents strong, independent evidence for cosmic acceleration. Systematic scatter remains undetected in the fgas data, despite a weighted mean statistical scatter in the distance measurements of only ~5 per cent. For a flat cosmology with a constant dark energy equation of state, we measure Ωm = 0.28 +/- 0.06 and w = -1.14 +/- 0.31. Combining the fgas data with independent constraints from cosmic microwave background and SNIa studies removes the need for priors on Ωbh2 and H0 and leads to tighter constraints: Ωm = 0.253 +/- 0.021 and w = -0.98 +/- 0.07 for the same constant-w model. Our most general analysis allows the equation of state to evolve with redshift. Marginalizing over possible transition redshifts 0.05 < zt < 1, the combined fgas + CMB + SNIa data set constrains the dark energy equation of state at late and early times to be w0 = -1.05 +/- 0.29 and wet = -0.83 +/- 0.46, respectively, in agreement with the cosmological constant paradigm. Relaxing the assumption of flatness weakens the constraints on the equation of state by only a factor of ~2. Our analysis includes conservative allowances for systematic uncertainties associated with instrument calibration, cluster physics and data modelling. The measured small systematic scatter, tight constraint on Ωm and powerful constraints on dark energy from the fgas data bode well for future dark energy studies using the next generation of powerful X-ray observatories, such as Constellation-X.},

abstract = {We investigate the gravitational lensing properties of dark matter halos with Navarro, Frenk {\&} White (NFW) density profiles and derive an analytic expression for the radial dependence of the shear, γ(x), due to these objects. In addition, we derive an expression for the mean shear interior to a given radius, γ(x), and use this to quantify systematic errors that will arise in weak-lensing mass estimates of astronomical objects in cases where the mass estimate is based on an a priori assumption that the underlying potential is that of a singular isothermal sphere when in fact the potential is that of an NFW-type object. On mass scales of 1011 Msolar<~M200<~1015 Msolar, the assumption of an isothermal sphere potential results in an overestimate of the halo mass, and the amount by which the mass is overestimated increases linearly with the value of the NFW concentration parameter. Considerable overestimates of the mass (~60%) can occur for galaxy-sized halos, but for rich clusters the mass overestimate is small. The degree to which the mass is systematically in error depends on the cosmology adopted, with a COBE-normalized standard cold dark matter (CDM) model yielding the largest systematic errors for a given true value of the halo mass.},

title = {SNLS3: Constraints on Dark Energy Combining the Supernova Legacy Survey Three-year Data with Other Probes},
abstract = {We present observational constraints on the nature of dark energy using the Supernova Legacy Survey three-year sample (SNLS3) of Guy et al. and Conley et al. We use the 472 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in this sample, accounting for recently discovered correlations between SN Ia luminosity and host galaxy properties, and include the effects of all identified systematic uncertainties directly in the cosmological fits. Combining the SNLS3 data with the full WMAP7 power spectrum, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey luminous red galaxy power spectrum, and a prior on the Hubble constant H 0 from SHOES, in a flat universe we find Ω m = 0.269 $\pm$ 0.015 and w = -1.061+0.069 - 0.068 (where the uncertainties include all statistical and SN Ia systematic errors)---a 6.5% measure of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w. The statistical and systematic uncertainties are approximately equal, with the systematic uncertainties dominated by the photometric calibration of the SN Ia fluxes---without these calibration effects, systematics contribute only a ~2% error in w. When relaxing the assumption of flatness, we find Ω m = 0.271 $\pm$ 0.015, Ω k = -0.002 $\pm$ 0.006, and w = -1.069+0.091 - 0.092. Parameterizing the time evolution of w as w(a) = w 0 + wa (1 - a) gives w 0 = -0.905 $\pm$ 0.196, wa = -0.984+1.094 - 1.097 in a flat universe. All of our results are consistent with a flat, w = -1 universe. The size of the SNLS3 sample allows various tests to be performed with the SNe segregated according to their light curve and host galaxy properties. We find that the cosmological constraints derived from these different subsamples are consistent. There is evidence that the coefficient, β, relating SN Ia luminosity and color, varies with host parameters at >4σ significance (in addition to the known SN luminosity-host relation); however, this has only a small effect on the cosmological results and is currently a subdominant systematic.},

title = {Revising the Halofit Model for the Nonlinear Matter Power Spectrum},
abstract = {Based on a suite of state-of-the-art high-resolution N-body simulations, we revisit the so-called halofit model as an accurate fitting formula for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. While the halofit model has frequently been used as a standard cosmological tool to predict the nonlinear matter power spectrum in a universe dominated by cold dark matter, its precision has been limited by the low resolution of N-body simulations used to determine the fitting parameters, suggesting the necessity of an improved fitting formula at small scales for future cosmological studies. We run high-resolution N-body simulations for 16 cosmological models around the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe best-fit cosmological parameters (one-, three-, five-, and seven-year results), including dark energy models with a constant equation of state. The simulation results are used to re-calibrate the fitting parameters of the halofit model so as to reproduce small-scale power spectra of the N-body simulations, while keeping the precision at large scales. The revised fitting formula provides an accurate prediction of the nonlinear matter power spectrum in a wide range of wavenumbers (k <= 30 h Mpc-1) at redshifts 0 <= z <= 10, with 5% precision for k <= 1 h Mpc-1 at 0 <= z <= 10 and 10% for 1 <= k <= 10 h Mpc-1 at 0 <= z <= 3. We discuss the impact of the improved halofit model on weak-lensing power spectra and correlation functions, and show that the improved model better reproduces ray-tracing simulation results.},

title = {STAGES: the Space Telescope A901/2 Galaxy Evolution Survey},
abstract = {We present an overview of the Space Telescope A901/2 Galaxy Evolution Survey (STAGES). STAGES is a multiwavelength project designed to probe physical drivers of galaxy evolution across a wide range of environments and luminosity. A complex multicluster system at z ~ 0.165 has been the subject of an 80-orbit F606W Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) mosaic covering the full span of the supercluster. Extensive multiwavelength observations with XMM-Newton, GALEX, Spitzer, 2dF, Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and the 17-band COMBO-17 photometric redshift survey complement the HST imaging. Our survey goals include simultaneously linking galaxy morphology with other observables such as age, star formation rate, nuclear activity and stellar mass. In addition, with the multiwavelength data set and new high-resolution mass maps from gravitational lensing, we are able to disentangle the large-scale structure of the system. By examining all aspects of an environment we will be able to evaluate the relative importance of the dark matter haloes, the local galaxy density and the hot X-ray gas in driving galaxy transformation. This paper describes the HST imaging, data reduction and creation of a master catalogue. We perform the S{\'e}rsic fitting on the HST images and conduct associated simulations to quantify completeness. In addition, we present the COMBO-17 photometric redshift catalogue and estimates of stellar masses and star formation rates for this field. We define galaxy and cluster sample selection criteria, which will be the basis for forthcoming science analyses, and present a compilation of notable objects in the field. Finally, we describe the further multiwavelength observations and announce public access to the data and catalogues.},

title = {Cosmological parameter constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering with the SDSS DR7},
abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the cross-correlation coefficient between galaxies and dark matter is very close to unity on scales outside a few virial radii of galaxy halos, independent of the details of how galaxies populate dark matter halos. This finding makes it possible to determine the dark matter clustering from measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy clustering. We present new cosmological parameter constraints based on large-scale measurements of spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7). We generalise the approach of Baldauf et al. (2010) to remove small scale information (below 2 and 4 Mpc/h for lensing and clustering measurements, respectively), where the cross-correlation coefficient differs from unity. We derive constraints for three galaxy samples covering 7131 sq. deg., containing 69150, 62150, and 35088 galaxies with mean redshifts of 0.11, 0.28, and 0.40. We clearly detect scale-dependent galaxy bias for the more luminous galaxy samples, at a level consistent with theoretical expectations. When we vary both \sigma_8 and {\O}mega_m with other cosmological parameters fixed (and marginalise over non-linear galaxy bias), the best-constrained quantity is \sigma_8 ({\O}mega_m/0.25)^{0.57}=0.80 +/- 0.05 (1-sigma, stat. + sys.), where statistical and systematic errors have comparable contributions. These strong constraints on the dark matter clustering suggest that this method is competitive with cosmic shear in current data, while having very complementary and in some ways less serious systematics. We therefore expect that this method will play a prominent role in future weak lensing surveys. When we combine these data with WMAP7 CMB data, constraints on \sigma_8, {\O}mega_m, H_0, w_{de} and \sum m_{\nu} become 30-80 per cent tighter than with CMB data alone, since our data break several parameter degeneracies.},

title = {New Constraints on the Evolution of the Stellar-to-dark Matter Connection: A Combined Analysis of Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing, Clustering, and Stellar Mass Functions from z = 0.2 to z =1},
abstract = {Using data from the COSMOS survey, we perform the first joint analysis of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy number densities. Carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter between stellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using a novel and self-consistent theoretical framework. Our results provide strong constraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) from z = 0.2 to z = 1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass scales as Mh vpropM 0.46 * and that this scaling does not evolve significantly with redshift from z = 0.2 to z = 1. The slope of the SHMR rises sharply at M * > 5 × 1010 M ⊙ and as a consequence, the stellar mass of a central galaxy becomes a poor tracer of its parent halo mass. We show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh /M *, varies from low to high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh /M * ~ 27 at M * = 4.5 × 1010 M ⊙ and Mh = 1.2 × 1012 M ⊙. This minimum is important for models of galaxy formation because it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the central galaxy has been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this minimum in terms of the "pivot stellar mass," M piv *, the "pivot halo mass," M piv h , and the "pivot ratio," (Mh /M *)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous analysis of a single data set spanning a large redshift range, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends for both M piv h and M piv *. The pivot stellar mass decreases from M piv * = 5.75 $\pm$ 0.13 × 1010 M ⊙ at z = 0.88 to M piv * = 3.55 $\pm$ 0.17 × 1010 M ⊙ at z = 0.37. Intriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of M piv h leaves the pivot ratio constant with redshift at (Mh /M *)piv ~ 27. We use simple arguments to show how this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching may ultimately depend on Mh /M * and not simply on Mh , as is commonly assumed. We show that simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in the sites of star formation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and active galactic nucleus feedback.

title = {How Robust Are the Size Measurements of High-redshift Compact Galaxies?},
abstract = {Massive quiescent galaxies at {\$}z \approx 2{\$} are apparently much more compact than galaxies of comparable mass today. How robust are these size measurements? We perform comprehensive simulations to determine possible biases and uncertainties in fitting single-component light distributions to real galaxies. In particular, we examine the robustness of the measurements of the luminosity, size, and other structural parameters. We devise simulations with increasing realism to systematically disentangle effects due to the technique (specifically using GALFIT) and the intrinsic structures of the galaxies. By accurately capturing the detailed substructures of nearby elliptical galaxies and then rescaling their sizes and signal-to-noise to mimic galaxies at different redshifts, we confirm that the massive quiescent galaxies at {\$}z \approx 2{\$} are significantly more compact intrinsically than their local counterparts. Their observed compactness is not a result of missing faint outer light due to systematic errors in modeling. In fact, we find that fitting multi-component galaxies with a single S{\'e}rsic profile, the procedure most commonly adopted in the literature, biases the inferred sizes higher by up to 10% - 20%, which accentuates the amount of size evolution required. If the sky estimation has been done robustly and the model for the point-spread function is fairly accurate, GALFIT can retrieve the properties of single-component galaxies over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios without introducing any systematic errors.},

abstract = {We present the theoretical and analytical bases of optimal techniques to measure weak gravitational shear from images of galaxies. We first characterize the geometric space of shears and ellipticity and then use this geometric interpretation to analyze images. The steps of this analysis include measurement of object shapes on images, combining measurements of a given galaxy on different images, estimating the underlying shear from an ensemble of galaxy shapes, and compensating for the systematic effects of image distortion, bias from point-spread function (PSF) asymmetries, and ``dilution'' of the signal by the seeing. These methods minimize the ellipticity measurement noise, provide calculable shear uncertainty estimates, and allow removal of systematic contamination by PSF effects to arbitrary precision. Galaxy images and PSFs are expressed as ``Laguerre expansions,'' a two-dimensional generalization of the Edgeworth expansion, making the PSF correction and shape measurement relatively straightforward and computationally efficient. We also discuss sources of noise-induced bias in weak-lensing measurements-selection biases, and ``centroid'' biases arising from noise rectification-and provide a solution for these and previously identified biases.},

title = {Noise bias in weak lensing shape measurements},
abstract = {Weak lensing experiments are a powerful probe into cosmology through their measurement of the mass distribution of the universe. A challenge for this technique is to control systematic errors that occur when measuring the shapes of distant galaxies. In this paper, we investigate noise bias, a systematic error that arises from second-order noise terms in the shape measurement process. We first derive analytical expressions for the bias of general maximum-likelihood estimators in the presence of additive noise. We then find analytical expressions for a simplified toy model in which galaxies are modelled and fitted with a Gaussian with its size as a single free parameter. Even for this very simple case we find a significant effect. We also extend our analysis to a more realistic six-parameter elliptical Gaussian model. We find that the noise bias is generically of the order of the inverse-squared signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the galaxies and is thus of the order of a percent for galaxies of SNR 10, i.e. comparable to the weak lensing shear signal. This is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than the systematic requirements for future all-sky weak lensing surveys. We discuss possible ways to circumvent this effect, including a calibration method using simulations discussed in an associated paper.},

abstract = {The High-Z Supernova Search is an international collaboration to discover and monitor Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at z > 0.2 with the aim of measuring cosmic deceleration and global curvature. Our collaboration has pursued a basic understanding of supernovae in the nearby universe, discovering and observing a large sample of objects and developing methods to measure accurate distances with SNe Ia. This paper describes the extension of this program to z >= 0.2, outlining our search techniques and follow-up program. We have devised high-throughput filters that provide accurate two-color rest frame B and V light curves of SNe Ia, enabling us to produce precise, extinction-corrected luminosity distances in the range 0.25 < z < 0.55. Sources of systematic error from K-corrections, extinction, selection effects, and evolution are investigated, and their effects estimated. We present photometric and spectral observations of SN 1995K, our program's first supernova (SN), and use the data to obtain a precise measurement of the luminosity distance to the z = 0.479 host galaxy. This object, when combined with a nearby sample of SNe, yields an estimate for the matter density of the universe of Omega_M=-0.2^+1.0_-0.8 if Omega_Lambda = 0. For a spatially flat universe composed of normal matter and a cosmological constant, we find Omega_M=0.4^+0.5_-0.4, Omega_Lambda=0.6^+0.4_-0.5. We demonstrate that with a sample of ~30 objects, we should be able to determine relative luminosity distances over the range 0 < z < 0.5 with sufficient precision to measure Omega_M with an uncertainty of +/-0.2.},

We divide the data into four redshift slices with effective redshifts {\$}z = [0.2,0.4,0.6,0.76]{\$} and in each of the samples measure and model the 2-point galaxy correlation function in parallel and transverse directions to the line-of-sight.

We investigate the sensitivity of our results to the details of the assumed model and the range of physical scales fitted, making close comparison with a set of N-body simulations for calibration. Our measurements are consistent with an independent power-spectrum analysis of a similar dataset, demonstrating that the results are not driven by systematic errors. We determine the pairwise velocity dispersion of the sample in a non-parametric manner, showing that it systematically increases with decreasing redshift, and investigate the Alcock-Paczynski effects of changing the assumed fiducial model on the results. Our techniques should prove useful for current and future galaxy surveys mapping the growth rate of structure using the 2-dimensional correlation function.},

title = {On the Effects of Line-of-Sight Structures on Lensing Flux-ratio Anomalies in a LCDM Universe},
abstract = {The flux-ratio anomalies observed in multiply-lensed quasar images are most plausibly explained as the result of perturbing structures superposed on the underlying smooth matter distribution of the primary lens. The cold dark matter cosmological model predicts that a large number of substructures should survive inside larger halos but, surprisingly, this population alone has been shown to be insufficient to explain the observed distribution of the flux ratios of quasar's multiple images. Additional contributions from other halos (and their own subhalos) projected along the line of sight to the primary lens have been considered as a possible explanation, with inconclusive results so far. We use ray tracing through the Millennium II simulation to investigate the importance of projection effects due to halos and subhalos of mass m>1E8 Msun/h and extend our analysis to lower masses, m>1E6 Msun/h, using Monte-Carlo halo distributions. We find that violations of the cusp-caustic relation caused by line-of-sight haloes are comparable to (or even larger than) those caused by intrinsic substructures. The magnitude of the violation depends strongly on the density profile and concentration of the intervening halos, but clustering plays only a minor role. For a typical lensing geometry (lens at redshift 0.6 and source at redshift 2), background haloes (behind the main lens) are more likely to cause a violation than foreground halos. The combined effect of substructures within the lens and along the line of sight in a LCDM universe results in a cusp-violation probability from lensing flux-ratio observations of ~20%. This is enough to reconcile the model with current data, but larger samples are required for a stronger test of the theory.},

title = {Fast Hamiltonian sampling for large scale structure inference},
abstract = {In this work we present a new and efficient Bayesian method for nonlinear three dimensional large scale structure inference. We employ a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler to obtain samples from a multivariate highly non-Gaussian lognormal Poissonian density posterior given a set of observations. The HMC allows us to take into account the nonlinear relations between the observations and the underlying density field which we seek to recover. As the HMC provides a sampled representation of the density posterior any desired statistical summary, such as the mean, mode or variance, can be calculated from the set of samples. Further, it permits us to seamlessly propagate non-Gaussian uncertainty information to any final quantity inferred from the set of samples. The developed method is extensively tested in a variety of test scenarios, taking into account a highly structured survey geometry and selection effects. Tests with a mock galaxy catalog based on the millennium run show that the method is able to recover the filamentary structure of the nonlinear density field. The results further demonstrate the feasibility of non-Gaussian sampling in high dimensional spaces, as required for precision nonlinear large scale structure inference. The HMC is a flexible and efficient method, which permits for simple extension and incorporation of additional observational constraints. Thus, the method presented here provides an efficient and flexible basis for future high precision large scale structure inference.},

title = {Optimal linear reconstruction of dark matter from halo catalogs},
abstract = {We derive the weight function w(M) to apply to dark-matter halos that minimizes the stochasticity between the weighted halo distribution and its underlying mass density field. The optimal w(M) depends on the range of masses being used in the estimator. In N-body simulations, the Poisson estimator is up to 15 times noisier than the optimal. Implementation of the optimal weight yields significantly lower stochasticity than weighting halos by their mass, bias or equal. Optimal weighting could make cosmological tests based on the matter power spectrum or cross-correlations much more powerful and/or cost-effective. A volume-limited measurement of the mass power spectrum at k=0.2h/Mpc over the entire z<1 universe could ideally be done using only 6 million redshifts of halos with mass M>6\times10^{13}h^{-1}M_{\o}dot (1\times10^{13}) at z=0 (z=1); this is 5 times fewer than the Poisson model predicts. Using halo occupancy distributions (HOD) we find that uniformly-weighted catalogs of luminous red galaxies require >3 times more redshifts than an optimally-weighted halo catalog to reconstruct the mass to the same accuracy. While the mean HODs of galaxies above a threshold luminosity are similar to the optimal w(M), the stochasticity of the halo occupation degrades the mass estimator. Blue or emission-line galaxies are about 100 times less efficient at reconstructing mass than an optimal weighting scheme. This suggests an efficient observational approach of identifying and weighting halos with a deep photo-z survey before conducting a spectroscopic survey. The optimal w(M) and mass-estimator stochasticity predicted by the standard halo model for M>10^{12}h^{-1}M_{\o}dot are in reasonable agreement with our measurements, with the important exceptions that the halos must be assumed to be linearly biased samples of a "halo field" that is distinct from the mass field.

abstract = {The two-point statistics of the gravitationally induced ellipticities of distant galaxy images which provide a direct probe of the mass fluctuation spectrum P(k) is analyzed. The relation between the ellipticity pattern of the background galaxies and the projected density of foreground matter is explored. This yields both useful statistical correlations and also an approximate method for directly imaging foreground mass concentrations. Angular power spectra are calculated using the analogue of Limber's equation in the Fourier domain, as well as angular correlation functions. It is found that there are some characteristic features of the ellipticity correlations that appear most clearly in the Fourier representation. The analysis is valid for arbitrary evolution of P(k) and for an arbitrary distance distribution for the galaxies. It is shown that the size of the effect on very large scales is tightly constrained by microwave anisotropy limits, but that the density fluctuations inferred from observed peculiar motions suggest interestingly large effects at angular scales below about a degree.},

title = {Cosmic-shear covariance: The log-normal approximation},
abstract = {Accurate estimates of the errors on the cosmological parameters inferred from cosmic shear surveys require accurate estimates of the covariance of the cosmic shear correlation functions. We seek approximations to the cosmic shear covariance that are as easy to use as the common approximations based on normal (Gaussian) statistics, but yield more accurate covariance matrices and parameter errors. We derive expressions for the cosmic shear covariance under the assumption that the underlying convergence field follows log-normal statistics. We also derive a simplified version of this log-normal approximation by only retaining the most important terms beyond normal statistics. We use numerical simulations of weak lensing to study how well the normal, log-normal, and simplified log-normal approximations reproduce shear covariances for cosmic shear surveys. Furthermore, we investigate the resulting confidence regions for cosmological parameters inferred from such surveys. We find that the normal approximation substantially underestimates the inferred parameter confidence regions, in particular for surveys with small fields of view and large galaxy densities. In contrast, the log-normal approximation yields more realistic confidence regions, but also requires evaluating slightly more complicated expressions. However, the simplified log-normal approximation, although as simple as the normal approximation, yields confidence regions that are as accurate as those obtained from the log-normal approximation. The simplified log-normal approximation should be used in favour of the normal approximation for parameter estimation and parameter error forecasts.},

We pay particular attention to the shot noise effect in {\$}N{\$}-body simulations by explicitly showing how it affects the variance of the convergence. We show that the convergence and magnification PDFs are closely related with each other via the approximate relation {\$}\mu=(1-\kappa)^{-2}{\$}, which can reproduce the behavior of PDFs surprisingly well up to the high magnification tail. The mean convergence measured in the source plane is found to be systematically negative, rather than zero as often assumed, and is correlated with the convergence variance. We provide simple analytical formulae for the PDFs, which reproduce simulated PDFs reasonably well for a wide range of redshifts and smoothing sizes. As explicit applications of our ray-tracing simulations, we examine the strong lensing probability and the magnification effects on the luminosity functions of distant galaxies and quasars.},

title = {Utilizing Type Ia Supernovae in a Large, Fast, Imaging Survey to Constrain Dark Energy},
abstract = {We study the utility of a large sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) that might be observed in an imaging survey that rapidly scans a large fraction of the sky for constraining dark energy. We consider both the information contained in the traditional luminosity distance test as well as the spread in Ia SN fluxes at fixed redshift induced by gravitational lensing. As would be required from an imaging survey, we include a treatment of photometric redshift uncertainties in our analysis. Our primary result is that the information contained in the mean distance moduli of SNe Ia and the dispersion of SN Ia distance moduli complement each other, breaking a degeneracy between the present dark energy equation of state and its time variation without the need for a high-redshift (z gsim 0.8) SN sample. Including lensing information also allows for some internal calibration of photometric redshifts. To address photometric redshift uncertainties, we present dark energy constraints as a function of the size of an external set of spectroscopically observed SNe that may be used for redshift calibration, N spec. Depending upon the details of potentially available, external SN data sets, we find that an imaging survey can constrain the dark energy equation of state at the epoch where it is best constrained w p, with a 1σ error of σ(w p) ≈ 0.03-0.09. In addition, the marginal improvement in the error σ(w p) from an increase in the spectroscopic calibration sample drops once N spec ~ a few × 103. This result is important because it is of the order of the size of calibration samples likely to be compiled in the coming decade and because, for samples of this size, the spectroscopic and imaging surveys individually place comparable constraints on the dark energy equation of state. In all cases, it is best to calibrate photometric redshifts with a set of spectroscopically observed SNe with relatively more objects at high redshift (z gsim 0.5) than the parent sample of imaging SNe.},

title = {Structure Finding in Cosmological Simulations: The State of Affairs},
abstract = {[abridged] The ever increasing size and complexity of data coming from simulations of cosmic structure formation demands equally sophisticated tools for their analysis. During the past decade, the art of object finding in these simulations has hence developed into an important discipline itself. A multitude of codes based upon a huge variety of methods and techniques have been spawned yet the question remained as to whether or not they will provide the same (physical) information about the structures of interest. This concern gave rise to a series of workshops and comparison papers of which we here present a brief summary. But we also go one step further and investigate in more detail the (possible) origin of any deviations across finders. To this extent we decipher and discuss differences in halo finding methods, clearly separating them from the disparity in definitions of halo properties. We observe that different codes not only find different numbers of objects leading to a scatter of up to 20 per cent in the halo mass and Vmax function, but also that the particulars of those objects that are identified by all finders differ. [...] We close with a discussion of the relevance and implications of the scatter across different codes for other fields such as semi-analytical galaxy formation models, gravitational lensing, and observables in general. In summary we conclude that while the majority of codes give results with a scatter below 1 per cent (at least for the most basic halo properties) once a particular definition has been specified, the residual differences for more complex quantities such as spin parameter are more sensitive to the particular implementation of the initial particle collection. We therefore caution any user of halo finders and their catalogues to not use the data blindly but to consider the mode of operation and definitions used during its generation.},

title = {Measuring primordial non-Gaussianity with weak-lensing surveys},
abstract = {We study the ability of future weak lensing (WL) surveys to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type. We use a large ensemble of simulated WL maps with survey specifications relevant to Euclid and LSST. The simulations assume Cold Dark Matter cosmologies that vary certain parameters around fiducial values: the non-Gaussianity parameter f_NL, the matter density parameter Omega_m, the amplitude of the matter power spectrum sigma_8, the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum n_s, and the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter w_0. We assess the sensitivity of the cosmic shear correlation functions, the third-order aperture mass statistics, and the abundance of shear peaks to these parameters. We find that each of the considered probes provides unmarginalized constraints of Delta f_NL ~ 20 on f_NL. Marginalized constraints from any individual WL probe are much weaker due to strong correlations between parameters. However, the parameter errors can be substantially reduced by combining information from different WL probes. Combining all WL probes yields the following marginal (68% confidence level) uncertainties: Delta f_NL ~ 50, Delta Omega_m ~ 0.002, Delta sigma_8 ~ 0.004, Delta n_s ~ 0.007, and Delta w_0 ~ 0.03. We examine the bias induced by neglecting f_NL on the constraints on the other parameters. We find sigma_8 and w_0 to be the most affected. Moreover, neglecting non-Gaussianity leads to a severe underestimation of the uncertainties in the other cosmological parameters.},

title = {A Method for Weak Lensing Observations},
abstract = {We develop and test a method for measuring the gravitational lensing-induced distortion of faint background galaxies. We first describe how we locate the galaxies and measure two-component "polarization" or ellipticity statistic eα whose expectation value should be proportional to the gravitational shear γα. We then show that an anisotropic instrumental point-spread function (PSF) perturbs the polarization by δeα = PsαβPβ, where pα is a measure of the PSF anisotropy and Psαβ is the "linearized smear polarizability tensor." By estimating Psαβ for each object we can determine pα from the foreground stars and apply a correction PsαβPβ to the galaxies. We test this procedure using deep high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) which are smeared with an anisotropic PSF and then have noise added to simulate ground-based observations. We find that the procedure works very well. A similar analysis yields a linear shear polarizability tensor Pγαβ which describes the response to a gravitational shear. This calibrates the polarization-shear relation, but only for galaxies which are well resolved. To empirically calibrate the effect of seeing on the smaller galaxies we artificially stretch HST images to simulate lensing and then degrade them as before. These experiments provide a rigorous and exacting test of the method under realistic conditions. They show that it is possible to remove the effect of instrumental PSF anisotropy and that the method provides an efficient and quantitative measurement of the gravitational shear.},

We optimistically ignore the competing effect of baryons for this work. We find approach (ii) to be conservative compared to approach (i). We evaluate cosmological constraints using these methods, marginalising over four other cosmological parameters.

title = {Hubble Space Telescope Weak-Lensing Study of the z=0.83 Cluster MS 1054-03},
abstract = {We have measured the weak gravitational lensing of faint, distant background galaxies by MS 1054-03, a rich and X-ray luminous cluster of galaxies at a redshift of z=0.83, using a two-color mosaic of deep WFPC2 images. The small corrections for the size of the point-spread function and the high number density of background galaxies obtained in these observations result in an accurate and well-calibrated measurement of the lensing induced distortion. The strength of the lensing signal depends on the redshift distribution of the background galaxies. We used photometric redshift distributions from the northern and southern Hubble Deep Fields to relate the lensing signal to the mass. The predicted variations of the signal as a function of apparent source magnitude and color agrees well with the observed lensing signal. The uncertainty in the redshift distribution results in a 10% systematic uncertainty in the mass measurement. We determine a mass of (1.2+/-0.2)x1015 h-150 Msolar within an aperture of radius 1 h-150 Mpc. Under the assumption of an isothermal mass distribution, the corresponding velocity dispersion is 1311+83-89 km s-1. For the mass-to-light ratio we find 269+/-37 h50 Msolar/LBsolar after correcting for passband and luminosity evolution. The errors in the mass and mass-to-light ratio include the contribution from the random intrinsic ellipticities of the source galaxies, but not the (systematic) error due to the uncertainty in the redshift distribution. However, the estimates for the mass and mass-to-light ratio of MS 1054-03 agree well with other estimators, suggesting that the mass calibration works well. The reconstruction of the projected mass surface density shows a complex mass distribution, consistent with the light distribution. The results indicate that MS 1054-03 is a young system. The timescale for relaxation is estimated to be at least 1 Gyr. We have also studied the masses of the cluster galaxies, by averaging the tangential shear around the cluster galaxies. Using the Faber-Jackson scaling relation, we find the velocity dispersion of an L* galaxy (LB=8x1010 h-250 LBsolar for MS 1054-03) is 203+/-33 km s-1.

abstract = {We present a three-dimensional (3D) lensing analysis of the z= 0.16 supercluster A901/2, resulting in a 3D map of the dark matter distribution within a 3 × 105[h-1 Mpc]3 volume. This map is generated from a combined catalogue of 3D galaxy coordinates together with shear estimates, using R-band imaging and photometric redshifts from the COMBO-17 survey. We perform a χ2 fit of isothermal spheres to the tangential shear pattern around each cluster as a function of redshift to estimate the 3D positions and masses of the main clusters in the supercluster from lensing alone. Motivated by the appearance of a second cluster behind A902 in galaxy number density, we also fit a two-cluster model to A902. We then present the first 3D map of the dark-matter gravitational potential field, Φ, from weak lensing using the Kaiser-Squires and Taylor inversion methods. These maps clearly show the potential wells of the main supercluster components, including the new cluster behind A902, and demonstrate the applicability of 3D dark-matter mapping and projection-free, mass-selected cluster finding to current data. Finally, we develop the halo model of dark matter and galaxy clustering and compare this with the auto- and cross-correlation functions of the 3D gravitational potential, galaxy number densities and galaxy luminosity densities measured in the A901/2 field. We find significant anticorrelations between the gravitational potential field and the galaxy number density and luminosities, as expected due to baryonic infall into dark-matter concentrations. We find good agreement with the halo model for the number densities and luminosity correlation functions, but some disagreement with the shape of the gravitational potential correlation function, which we attribute to finite-field effects.},

title = {Probing deviations from General Relativity with the Euclid spectroscopic survey},
abstract = {We discuss the ability of the planned Euclid mission to detect deviations from General Relativity using its extensive redshift survey of more than 50 Million galaxies. Constraints on the gravity theory are placed measuring the growth rate of structure within 14 redshift bins between z=0.7 and z=2. The growth rate is measured from redshift-space distortions, i.e. the anisotropy of the clustering pattern induced by coherent peculiar motions. This is performed in the overall context of the Euclid spectroscopic survey, which will simultaneously measure the expansion history of the universe, using the power spectrum and its baryonic features as a standard ruler, accounting for the relative degeneracies of expansion and growth parameters. The resulting expected errors on the growth rate in the different redshift bins, expressed through the quantity f\sigma_8, range between 1.3% and 4.4%. We discuss the optimisation of the survey configuration and investigate the important dependence on the growth parameterisation and the assumed cosmological model. We show how a specific parameterisation could actually drive the design towards artificially restricted regions of the parameter space. Finally, in the framework of the popular "\gamma -parameterisation", we show that the Euclid spectroscopic survey alone will already be able to provide substantial evidence (in Bayesian terms) if the growth index differs from the GR value \gamma=0.55 by at least \sim 0.13. This will combine with the comparable inference power provided by the Euclid weak lensing survey, resulting in Euclid's unique ability to provide a decisive test of modified gravity.},

title = {Intrinsic correlation of galaxy shapes: implications for weak lensing measurements},
abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing is now established as a powerful method to measure mass fluctuations in the universe. It relies on the measurement of small coherent distortions of the images of background galaxies. Even low-level correlations in the intrinsic shapes of galaxies could however produce a significant spurious lensing signal. These correlations are also interesting in their own right, since their detection would constrain models of galaxy formation. Using ɛi [(α2-β2)/α2-β2)] {cos 2α,sin 2α}, 3×104-105 haloes found in N-body simulations, we compute the correlation functions of the intrinsic ellipticity of spiral galaxies assuming that the disc is perpendicular to the angular momentum of the dark matter halo. We also consider a simple model for elliptical galaxies, in which the shape of the dark matter halo is assumed to be the same as that of the light. For deep lensing surveys with median redshifts ~1, we find that intrinsic correlations of ~10-4 on angular scales ɛir, q~0.1-10arcmin are generally below the expected lensing signal, and contribute only a small fraction of the excess signals reported on these scales. On larger scales we find limits to the intrinsic correlation function at a level ~10-5, which gives a (model-dependent) range of separations for which the intrinsic signal is about an order of magnitude below the ellipticity correlation function expected from weak lensing. Intrinsic correlations are thus negligible on these scales for dedicated weak lensing surveys. For wider but shallower surveys such as SuperCOSMOS, APM and SDSS, we cannot exclude the possibility that intrinsic correlations could dominate the lensing signal. We discuss how such surveys could be used to calibrate the importance of this effect, as well as study spin-spin correlations of spiral galaxies.},

We simulate otherwise-empty cluster fields for 96 different virial mass-redshift combinations spanning the ranges {\$}3\times10^{13}h^{-1}M_{\o}dot \le M_{vir}\le 10^{15}h^{-1}M_{\o}dot{\$} and {\$}0.05 \le z_{\rm cl} \le 0.75{\$}, and for each generate 1000 realisations of noisy shear data in 2D and 3D. For each field, we then compute the cluster (false) detection rate as the mean number of cluster (false) detections per reconstruction over the sample of 1000 reconstructions. We show that both MRLens and GLIMPSE are effective tools for the detection of clusters from weak lensing measurements, and provide comparable quality reconstructions at low redshift. At high redshift, GLIMPSE reconstructions offer increased sensitivity in the detection of clusters, yielding cluster detection rates up to a factor of {\$}\sim 10\times{\$} that seen in 2D reconstructions using MRLens. We conclude that 3D mass mapping techniques are more efficient for the detection of clusters of galaxies in weak lensing surveys than 2D methods, particularly since 3D reconstructions yield unbiased estimators of both the mass and redshift of the detected clusters directly.},

title = {Weak Lensing Measurements: A Revisited Method and Application toHubble Space Telescope Images},
abstract = {The weak distortions produced by gravitational lensing in the images of background galaxies provide a unique method to measure directly the distribution of mass in the universe. However, because the induced distortions are only of a few percent, this technique requires high-precision measurements of the lensing shear and cautious corrections for systematic effects. Kaiser, Squires, {\&} Broadhurst proposed a method to calibrate the ellipticity-shear relation in the presence of point-spread function (PSF) anisotropies and camera distortions. Here, we revisit the Kaiser, Squires, {\&} Broadhurst method in the context of the demanding search for weak lensing by large-scale structure. We show that both the PSF and the camera distortions can be corrected for using source moments, as opposed to ellipticities. We clarify the applicability of some of the approximations made in this method. We derive expressions for the corrections that involve only the galaxy moments. By decomposing the moments into spinors, we derive an explicit relation between the shear and the average ellipticity. We discuss the shortcomings of the method and test its validity using numerical simulations. As an application of the method, we repeat the analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFPC2 camera performed by Hoekstra et al. We confirm the presence of sizable (~10%) PSF ellipticities at the edge of the WFPC2 chips. However, we find that the camera distortion is radial, rather than tangential. We also show that the PSF ellipticity varies by as much as 2% over time. We use these measurements to correct the shape of galaxies in the HST Survey Strip (the ``Groth'' Strip). By considering the dependence of the ellipticities on object size, we show that, after corrections, the residual systematic uncertainty for galaxies with radii greater than 0.15" is about 0.4% when averaged over each chip. We discuss how these results provide good prospects for measuring weak lensing by large-scale structure with deep HST surveys.},

title = {Reconstructing cosmological initial conditions from galaxy peculiar velocities. I. Reverse Zeldovich Approximation},
abstract = {We propose a new method to recover the cosmological initial conditions of the presently observed galaxy distribution, which can serve to run constrained simulations of the Local Universe. Our method, the Reverse Zeldovich Approximation (RZA), can be applied to radial galaxy peculiar velocity data and extends the previously used Constrained Realizations (CR) method by adding a Lagrangian reconstruction step. The RZA method consists of applying the Zeldovich approximation in reverse to galaxy peculiar velocities to estimate the cosmic displacement field and the initial linear matter distribution from which the present-day Local Universe evolved.We test our method with a mock survey taken from a cosmological simulation. We show that the halo peculiar velocities at z = 0 are close to the linear prediction of the Zeldovich approximation, if a grouping is applied to the data to remove virial motions. We find that the addition of RZA to the CR method significantly improves the reconstruction of the initial conditions. The RZA is able to recover the correct initial positions of the velocity tracers with a median error of only 1.36 Mpc/h in our test simulation. For realistic sparse and noisy data, this median increases to 5 Mpc/h. This is a significant improvement over the previous approach of neglecting the displacement field, which introduces errors on a scale of 10 Mpc/h or even higher. Applying the RZA method to the upcoming high-quality observational peculiar velocity catalogues will generate much more precise constrained simulations of the Local Universe.},

title = {Joint Analysis of Gravitational Lensing, Clustering and Abundance: Toward the Unification of Large-Scale Structure Analysis},
abstract = {We explore three different methods based on weak lensing to extract cosmological constraints from the large-scale structure. In the first approach (method I), small-scale galaxy lensing measurements of their halo mass provide a constraint on the halo bias, which can be combined with the large-scale galaxy clustering to measure the dark matter clustering. In the second approach (method II), large-scale galaxy clustering and large-scale galaxy-galaxy lensing can be combined into a direct measurement of the dark matter clustering. These two methods can be combined into one method I+II to make use of lensing measurements on all scales. In the third approach (method III), we add abundance information to the method I. We explore the statistical power of these three approaches as a function of galaxy luminosity to investigate the optimal mass range for each method and their cosmological constraining power. In the case of the SDSS, we find that the three methods give comparable constraints, but not in the same mass range: the method II works best for halos of M~10^13 Msun, and the methods I and III work best for halos of M~10^14 Msun. We discuss the robustness of each method against various systematics. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the future large-scale galaxy surveys and find that the cluster abundance method is not superior to the combined method I+II, both in terms of statistical power and robustness against systematic errors. The cosmic shear-shear correlation analysis in the future surveys yields constraints as strong as the combined method, but suffer from additional systematic effects. We thus advocate the combined analysis of clustering and lensing (method I+II) as a powerful alternative to other large-scale probes. Our analysis provides a guidance to observers planning large-scale galaxy surveys such as the DES, Euclid, and the LSST.},

title = {Lensing Magnification: A Novel Method to Weigh High-redshift Clusters and its Application to SpARCS},
abstract = {We introduce a novel method to measure the masses of galaxy clusters at high redshift selected from optical and IR Spitzer data via the red-sequence technique. Lyman-break galaxies are used as a well-understood, high-redshift background sample allowing mass measurements of lenses at unprecedented high redshifts using weak lensing magnification. By stacking a significant number of clusters at different redshifts with average masses of ~(1-3) × 1014 M sun, as estimated from their richness, we can calibrate the normalization of the mass-richness relation. With the current data set (area: 6 deg2) we detect a magnification signal at the >3σ level. There is good agreement between the masses estimated from the richness of the clusters and the average masses estimated from magnification, albeit with large uncertainties. We perform tests that suggest the absence of strong systematic effects and support the robustness of the measurement. This method---when applied to larger data sets in the future---will yield an accurate calibration of the mass-observable relations at z >~ 1 which will represent an invaluable input for cosmological studies using the galaxy cluster mass function and astrophysical studies of cluster formation. Furthermore, this method will probably be the least expensive way to measure masses of large numbers of z > 1 clusters detected in future IR-imaging surveys.},

abstract = {The ESA's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14 May 2009 and has been scanning the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 August 2009. This paper gives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis, and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. The science products include maps of the CMB and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the SZ effect. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data and a lensing likelihood are described. Scientific results include robust support for the standard six-parameter LCDM model of cosmology and improved measurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature distribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. Planck's results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Planck finds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some tension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derived from CMB data and that derived from SZ data. The Planck and WMAP power spectra are offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the first acoustic peak.},

Taking into account a broad spectrum of physics affecting growth - dynamical dark energy, extended gravity, neutrino masses, and spatial curvature - we analyze the cosmological constraints. Similarly we consider the effects of a range of systematic uncertainties, in shear measurement, photometric redshifts, and the nonlinear power spectrum, on cosmological parameter extraction. We also investigate, and provide fitting formulas for, the influence of survey parameters such as redshift depth, galaxy number densities, and sky area.

The former allow for measurements of weak lensing, galaxy clustering and cross-correlations such as the ISW effect. The latter probe galaxy dynamics through redshift space distortions. We use a set of basic observables, namely lensing power spectra, galaxy-lensing and galaxy-velocity cross-spectra in multiple redshift bins (including their covariances), to estimate the ability of upcoming surveys to test gravity theories. We use a two-parameter description of gravity that allows for the Poisson equation and the ratio of metric potentials to depart from general relativity. We find that the combination of imaging and spectroscopic observables is essential in making robust tests of gravity theories. The range of scales and redshifts best probed by upcoming surveys is discussed. We also compare our parametrization to others used in the literature, in particular the gamma parameter modification of the growth factor.},

title = {The COMBO-17 survey: Evolution of the galaxy luminosity function from 25 000 galaxies with 0.2< z <1.2},
abstract = {We present a detailed empirical assessment of how the galaxy luminosity function and stellar luminosity density evolves over the last half of the universe's age (0.2<z<1.2) for galaxies of different spectral energy distributions (SED). The results are based on ~ 25 000 galaxies (Rla24 ) with redshift measurements (sigmaz ~ 0.03) and SEDs across lambdaobs~ 350... 930 nm. The redshifts and SEDs were derived from medium-band photometry in 17 filters, observed as part of the COMBO-17 survey (``Classifying Objects by Medium-Band Observations in 17 Filters'') over three disjoint fields with a total area of 0.78 square degrees. Luminosity functions (LF), binned in redshift and SED-type, are presented in the restframe passbands of the SDSS r-band, the Johnson B-band and a synthetic UV continuum band at 280 nm.  We find that the luminosity function depends strongly on SED-type at all redshifts covered. The shape of the LF, i.e. the faint-end power-law slope, does depend on SED type, but not on redshift. However, the redshift evolution of the characteristic luminosity M* and density phi * depends strongly on SED-type: (1) Early-type galaxies, defined as redder than a present-day reference Sa spectrum, become drastically more abundant towards low redshift, by a factor of 10 in the number density phi * from z=1.1 to now, and by a factor of 4 in their contribution to the co-moving r-band luminosity density, jr. (2) Galaxies resembling present-day Sa- to Sbc-colours show a co-moving number density and contribution to jr that does not vary much with redshift. (3) Galaxies with blue spectra reflecting strong star formation decrease towards low redshift both in luminosity and density, and by a factor of 4 in their jr contribution. Summed over all SED types and galaxy luminosities, the comoving luminosity density decreases towards low redshift, between z=1.1 and now, by a small amount in restframe r and B, but by a factor of ~ 6 in restframe 280 nm. At z=1.1, galaxies redder than Sbc's, contribute 40% to the total jr, which increases to 75% by z=0. For lambdarest=280 nm, this increase is from 12% to 25% over the same redshift interval.  Comparison of the three independent sight-lines shows that our results are not significantly affected by large-scale structure. Our lowest redshift bin at z= [0.2,0.4] largely agrees with the recent assessment of the present-day galaxy population by SDSS and 2dFGRS and deviates only by an excess of ``faint blue galaxies'' at z ~ 0.3 compared to very local samples. Overall our findings provide a set of new and much more precise constraints to model the waning of overall star formation activity, the demise of star-bursts and the strong emergence of ``old'' galaxies, with hardly any young population, over the last 6-8 Gigayears.

title = {A New Data Compression Method and its Application to Cosmic Shear Analysis},
abstract = {Future large scale cosmological surveys will provide huge data sets whose analysis requires efficient data compression. Calculating accurate covariances is extremely challenging with increasing number of statistics used. Here we introduce a formalism for achieving efficient data compression, based on a local expansion of statistical measures around a fiducial cosmological model. We specifically apply and test this approach for the case of cosmic shear statistics. We demonstrate the performance of our approach, using a Fisher analysis on cosmic shear tomography described in terms of E-/B-mode separating statistics (COSEBIs). We show that our data compression is highly effective in extracting essentially the full cosmological information from a strongly reduced number of observables. Specifically, the number of statistics needed decreases by at least one order of magnitude relative to the COSEBIs, which already compress the data substantially compared to the shear two-point correlation functions. The efficiency appears to be affected only slightly if a highly inaccurate covariance is used for defining the compressed statistics, showing the robustness of the method. We conclude that an efficient data compression is achievable and that the number of compressed statistics depends on the number of model parameters. In addition, we study how well band powers can be obtained from measuring shear correlation functions over a finite interval of separations. We show the strong limitations on the possibility to construct top-hat filters in Fourier space, for which the real-space analog has a finite support, yielding strong bounds on the accuracy of band power estimates. The error on an estimated band-power is larger for a narrower filter and a smaller angular range which for relevant cases can be as large as 10%.},

title = {Revising the Halofit Model for the Nonlinear Matter Power Spectrum},
abstract = {Based on a suite of state-of-the-art high-resolution {\$}N{\$}-body simulations, we revisit the so-called halofit model (Smith et al. 2003) as an accurate fitting formula for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. While the halofit model has been frequently used as a standard cosmological tool to predict the nonlinear matter power spectrum in a universe dominated by cold dark matter, its precision has been limited by the low-resolution of {\$}N{\$}-body simulations used to determine the fitting parameters, suggesting the necessity of improved fitting formula at small scales for future cosmological studies. We run high-resolution {\$}N{\$}-body simulations for 16 cosmological models around the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) best-fit cosmological parameters (1, 3, 5, and 7 year results), including dark energy models with a constant equation of state. The simulation results are used to re-calibrate the fitting parameters of the halofit model so as to reproduce small-scale power spectra of the {\$}N{\$}-body simulations, while keeping the precision at large scales. The revised fitting formula provides an accurate prediction of the nonlinear matter power spectrum in a wide range of wavenumber ({\$}k \leq 30h{\$}\,Mpc{\$}^{-1}{\$}) at redshifts {\$}0 \leq z \leq 10{\$}, with 5% precision for {\$}k\leq1 h{\$} Mpc{\$}^{-1}{\$} at {\$}0 \leq z \leq 10{\$} and 10% for {\$}1 \leq k\leq 10 h{\$} Mpc{\$}^{-1} {\$} at {\$}0 \leq z \leq 3{\$}. We discuss the impact of the improved halofit model on weak lensing power spectra and correlation functions, and show that the improved model better reproduces ray-tracing simulation results.},

Any parameter estimate that is given without an error estimate is meaningless. Nevertheless, many (undergraduate or graduate) students have to teach such methods for error estimation to themselves when working scientifically for the first time. This manuscript presents an easy-to-understand overview of different methods for error estimation that are applicable to both model-based and model-independent parameter estimates. These methods are not discussed in detail, but their basics are briefly outlined and their assumptions carefully noted. In particular, the methods for error estimation discussed are grid search, varying {\$}\chi^2{\$}, the Fisher matrix, Monte-Carlo methods, error propagation, data resampling, and bootstrapping. Finally, a method is outlined how to propagate measurement errors through complex data-reduction pipelines.},

We demonstrate that the redshift probability distribution function summed over galaxies provides an accurate representation of the galaxy redshift distribution accounting for random and catastrophic errors for galaxies with best-fitting photometric redshifts zp < 1.3. We present cosmological constraints using tomographic weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure. We use two broad redshift bins 0.5 < zp ≤ 0.85 and 0.85 < zp ≤ 1.3 free of intrinsic alignment contamination, and measure the shear correlation function on angular scales in the range ˜1-40 arcmin. We show that the problematic redshift scaling of the shear signal, found in previous Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey data analyses, does not affect the CFHTLenS data. For a flat Λ cold dark matter model and a fixed matter density Ωm = 0.27, we find the normalization of the matter power spectrum σ8 = 0.771 $\pm$ 0.041. When combined with cosmic microwave background data (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7-year results), baryon acoustic oscillation data (BOSS) and a prior on the Hubble constant from the Hubble Space Telescope distance ladder, we find that CFHTLenS improves the precision of the fully marginalized parameter estimates by an average factor of 1.5-2. Combining our results with the above cosmological probes, we find Ωm = 0.2762 $\pm$ 0.0074 and σ8 = 0.802 $\pm$ 0.013.},

title = {What is the best way to measure baryonic acoustic oscillations?},
abstract = {Oscillations in the baryon-photon fluid prior to recombination imprint different signatures on the power spectrum and correlation function of matter fluctuations. The measurement of these features using galaxy surveys has been proposed as means to determine the equation of state of the dark energy. The accuracy required to achieve competitive constraints demands an extremely good understanding of systematic effects which change the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) imprint. We use 50 very large volume N-body simulations to investigate the BAO signature in the two-point correlation function. The location of the BAO bump does not correspond to the sound horizon scale at the level of accuracy required by future measurements, even before any dynamical or statistical effects are considered. Careful modelling of the correlation function is therefore required to extract the cosmological information encoded on large scales. We find that the correlation function is less affected by scale-dependent effects than the power spectrum. We show that a model for the correlation function proposed by Crocce {\&} Scoccimarro, based on renormalized perturbation theory, gives an essentially unbiased measurement of the dark energy equation of state. This means that information from the large-scale shape of the correlation function, in addition to the form of the BAO peak, can be used to provide robust constraints on cosmological parameters. The correlation function therefore provides a better constraint on the distance scale (~50 per cent smaller errors with no systematic bias) than the more conservative approach required when using the power spectrum (i.e. which requires amplitude and long-wavelength shape information to be discarded).},

abstract = {Since cosmology is no longer "the data-starved science," the problem of how to analyze large data sets best has recently received considerable attention, and Karhunen-Loeve eigenvalue methods have been applied to both galaxy redshift surveys and cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps. We present a comprehensive discussion of methods for estimating cosmological parameters from large data sets, which includes the previously published techniques as special cases. We show that both the problem of estimating several parameters jointly and the problem of not knowing the parameters a priori can be readily solved by adding an extra singular value decomposition step. It has recently been argued that the information content in a sky map from a next-generation CMB satellite is sufficient to measure key cosmological parameters (h, Omega , Lamda , etc.) to an accuracy of a few percent or better---in principle. In practice, the data set is so large that both a brute force likelihood analysis and a direct expansion in signal-to-noise eigenmodes will be computationally unfeasible. We argue that it is likely that a Karhunen-Loeve approach can nonetheless measure the parameters with close to maximal accuracy, if preceded by an appropriate form of quadratic "precompression." We also discuss practical issues regarding parameter estimation from present and future galaxy redshift surveys and illustrate this with a generalized eigenmode analysis of the IRAS 1.2 Jy survey optimized for measuring beta = Omega 0.6/b using redshift space distortions.},

title = {Power Spectrum Tomography with Weak Lensing},
abstract = {Upcoming weak lensing surveys on wide fields will provide the opportunity to reconstruct the structure along the line of sight tomographically by employing photometric redshift information about the source distribution. We define power spectrum statistics (including cross-correlation between redshift bins), quantify the improvement that redshift information can make in cosmological parameter estimation, and discuss ways to optimize the redshift binning. We find that within the adiabatic cold dark matter class of models, crude tomography using two or three redshift bins is sufficient to extract most of the information and improve, by up to an order of magnitude, the measurements of cosmological parameters that determine the growth rate of structure.},

title = {The redshift and scale dependence of the cosmic shear signal from  numerical simulations},
abstract = { The weak lensing shear signal has been measured numerically in {\$}N{\$}-body simulations at 14 different redshifts ({\$}z_s = 0.1{\$} to 3.6) and on angular scales of {\$}\theta = 2'{\$} to 32'. In addition, the data have been validated by analytical computations for an identical cosmology, with density parameter {\$}{\O}mega_m = 0.3{\$} and vacuum energy density parameter {\$}\lambda_0 = 0.7{\$}. This paper reports on the scale and redshift dependence of the shear variance, {\$}<\gamma^2>{\$}, which may be described by a simple formula of the form {\$}<\gamma^2>(\theta,z_s) = a(\theta)z_s^{b(\theta)}{\$}. The redshift dependence for source redshifts up to 1.6, is found to be close to {\$}z_s^2{\$}, which is a stronger dependence than earlier analytical predictions ({\$}<\gamma^2 > \propto z_s^{1.52}{\$}), although, at higher redshifts, the {\$}z_s{\$} dependence of the shear variance is clearly less steep. The strong redshift dependence further emphasises the need to know the precise redshift distribution for the galaxy sources in any given survey, so that they can be allocated to redshift bins accordingly, and the cosmic shear signal correctly interpreted. Equations are also given for the variance in the reduced shear, which is a more directly measurable quantity observationally. },

The acceleration of the Universe is, along with dark matter, the observed phenomenon that most directly demonstrates that our theories of fundamental particles and gravity are either incorrect or incomplete. Most experts believe that nothing short of a revolution in our understanding of fundamental physics will be required to achieve a full understanding of the cosmic acceleration. For these reasons, the nature of dark energy ranks among the very most compelling of all outstanding problems in physical science. These circumstances demand an ambitious observational program to determine the dark energy properties as well as possible.},

abstract = { The intrinsic alignment of galaxies constitutes the major astrophysical source of systematic errors in surveys of weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure. We discuss the principles, summarise the implementation, and highlight the performance of two model-independent methods that control intrinsic alignment signals in weak lensing data: the nulling technique which eliminates intrinsic alignments to ensure unbiased constraints on cosmology, and the boosting technique which extracts intrinsic alignments and hence allows one to further study this contribution. Making only use of the characteristic dependence on redshift of the signals, both approaches are robust, but reduce the statistical power due to the similar redshift scaling of intrinsic alignment and lensing signals. },

title = {Magnification Effects as Measures of Large-Scale Structure},
abstract = {The magnification effects of clustered matter produce variations in the image sizes and number densities of galaxies across the sky. This Letter advocates the use of these effects in wide-field surveys to map large-scale structure and the profiles of galaxy- and cluster-sized halos. The magnitude of the size variation as a function of angular scale is computed, and the signal-to-noise ratio is estimated for different survey parameters. Forthcoming surveys, especially well-designed space-based imaging surveys, will have high signal-to-noise ratios on scales of about 0.1‧ to several degrees. Thus, the clustering of matter could be measured on spatial scales of about 50 kpc-100 Mpc. The signal-to-noise ratio is dominated by sample variance rather than shot noise because of the finite number density of galaxies; hence, the accuracy of the measurements will be limited primarily by survey area, sampling strategy, and possible systematics. Methods based on magnification are compared with the use of shape distortions, and the contrasts and complementaries are discussed. Future work, which is needed to plan survey strategy and interpret measurements based on magnification, is outlined.},

title = {Weak-Lensing Measurements of 42 SDSS/RASS Galaxy Clusters},
abstract = {We present a lensing study of 42 galaxy clusters imaged in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) commissioning data. Cluster candidates are selected optically from SDSS imaging data and confirmed for this study by matching to X-ray sources found independently in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS). Five-color SDSS photometry is used to make accurate (Δz=0.018) photometric redshift estimates that are used to rescale and combine the lensing measurements. The mean shear from these clusters is detected to 2 h-1 Mpc at the 7 σ level, corresponding to a mass within that radius of (4.2+/-0.6)×1014 h-1 Msolar. The shear profile is well fitted by a power law with index -0.9+/-0.3, consistent with that of an isothermal density profile. Clusters are divided by X-ray luminosity into two subsets, with mean LX of (0.14+/-0.03)×1044 and (1.0+/-0.09)×1044 h-2 ergs s-1. The average lensing signal is converted to a projected mass density based on fits to isothermal density profiles. From this we calculate a mean r500 (the radius at which the mean density falls to 500 times the critical density) and M(<r500). The mass contained within r500 differs substantially between the low- and high-LX bins, with (0.7+/-0.2)×1014 and 2.7+0.9-1.1×1014h-1 Msolar, respectively. This paper demonstrates our ability to measure ensemble cluster masses from SDSS imaging data. The full SDSS data set will include >~1000 SDSS/RASS clusters. With this large data set we will measure the M-LX relation with high precision and put direct constraints on the mass density of the universe.},

This paper presents the power spectrum of the galaxy distribution, calculated using a direct Fourier transform based technique. We argue that, within the k-space region 0.02<~k<~0.15hMpc-1, the shape of this spectrum should be close to that of the linear density perturbations convolved with the window function of the survey. This window function and its convolving effect on the power spectrum estimate are analysed in detail. By convolving model spectra, we are able to fit the power-spectrum data and provide a measure of the matter content of the Universe. Our results show that models containing baryon oscillations are mildly preferred over featureless power spectra. Analysis of the data yields 68 per cent confidence limits on the total matter density times the Hubble parameter Ωmh=0.20+/-0.03, and the baryon fraction Ωb/Ωm=0.15+/-0.07, assuming scale-invariant primordial fluctuations.},

title = {A Line-of-Sight Integration Approach to Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropies},
abstract = {We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background (CM B) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions, which do not depend on the particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of photon, baryon, and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates the dynamical from the geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More importantly, it allows us to significantly reduce the computational time compared to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on the model and is generally the most time-consuming part of calculation, is a slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms require a much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about 2 orders of magnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become with the next generation of experiments. A program implementing this method can be obtained from the authors.},

abstract = {We investigate the extent to which the pure magnification effect of gravitational lensing can be extracted from galaxy clustering statistics, by a nulling method which aims to eliminate terms arising from the intrinsic clustering of galaxies. The aim is to leave statistics which are free from the uncertainties of galaxy bias. We find that nulling can be done effectively, leaving data which are relatively insensitive to uncertainties in galaxy bias and its evolution, leading to cosmological parameter estimation which is effectively unbiased. This advantage comes at the expense of increased statistical errors, which are in some cases large, but it offers a robust alternative analysis method to cosmic shear for cosmological imaging surveys designed for weak-lensing studies, or to full modelling of the clustering signal including magnification effects.},

abstract = {Gravitational lensing magnification is measured with a significance of 9.7σ on a large sample of galaxy clusters in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). This survey covers ˜154 deg2 and contains over 18 000 cluster candidates at redshifts 0.2 ≤ z ≤ 0.9, detected using the 3D-Matched Filter cluster-finder of Milkeraitis et al. We fit composite-NFW models to the ensemble, accounting for cluster miscentring, source-lens redshift overlap, as well as nearby structure (the two-halo term), and recover mass estimates of the cluster dark matter haloes in range of ˜1013 M⊙ to 2 × 1014 M⊙. Cluster richness is measured for the entire sample, and we bin the clusters according to both richness and redshift. A mass-richness relation M200 = M0(N200/20)β is fit to the measurements. For two different cluster miscentring models, we find consistent results for the normalization and slope, M0 = (2.3 $\pm$ 0.2) × 1013 M⊙, β = 1.4 $\pm$ 0.1 and M0 = (2.2 $\pm$ 0.2) × 1013 M⊙, β = 1.5 $\pm$ 0.1. We find that accounting for the full redshift distribution of lenses and sources is important, since any overlap can have an impact on mass estimates inferred from flux magnification.},

title = {COSEBIs: Extracting the full E-/B-mode information from cosmic shear correlation functions},
abstract = {Context. Cosmic shear is considered one of the most powerful methods for studying the properties of dark energy in the Universe. As a standard method, the two-point correlation functions ξ_$\pm$(ϑ) of the cosmic shear field are used as statistical measures for the shear field. Aims: In order to separate the observed shear into E- and B-modes, the latter being most likely produced by remaining systematics in the data set and/or intrinsic alignment effects, several statistics have been defined before. Here we aim at a complete E-/B-mode decomposition of the cosmic shear information contained in the ξ_$\pm$ on a finite angular interval. Methods: We construct two sets of such E-/B-mode measures, namely Complete Orthogonal Sets of E-/B-mode Integrals (COSEBIs), characterized by weight functions between the ξ_$\pm$ and the COSEBIs which are polynomials in ϑ or polynomials in lnϑ, respectively. Considering the likelihood in cosmological parameter space, constructed from the COSEBIs, we study their information content. Results: We show that the information grows with the number of COSEBI modes taken into account, and that an asymptotic limit is reached which defines the maximum available information in the E-mode component of the ξ_$\pm$. We show that this limit is reached the earlier (i.e., for a smaller number of modes considered) the narrower the angular range is over which ξ_$\pm$ are measured, and it is reached much earlier for logarithmic weight functions. For example, for ξ_$\pm$ on the interval 1' ≤ ϑ ≤ 400', the asymptotic limit for the parameter pair (Ωm, σ_8) is reached for 25 modes in the linear case, but already for 5 modes in the logarithmic case. The COSEBIs form a natural discrete set of quantities, which we suggest as method of choice in future cosmic shear likelihood analyses.},

title = {B-modes in cosmic shear from source redshift clustering},
abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing by the large scale structure can be used to probe the dark matter distribution in the Universe directly and thus to probe cosmological models. The recent detection of cosmic shear by several groups has demonstrated the feasibility of this new mode of observational cosmology. In the currently most extensive analysis of cosmic shear, it was found that the shear field contains unexpected modes, so-called B-modes, which are thought to be unaccountable for by lensing. B-modes can in principle be generated by an intrinsic alignment of galaxies from which the shear is measured, or may signify some remaining systematics in the data reduction and analysis. In this paper we show that B-modes in fact are produced by lensing itself. The effect comes about through the clustering of source galaxies, which in particular implies an angular separation-dependent clustering in redshift. After presenting the theory of the decomposition of a general shear field into E- and B-modes, we calculate their respective power spectra and correlation functions for a clustered source distribution. Numerical and analytical estimates of the relative strength of these two modes show that the resulting B-mode is very small on angular scales larger than a few arcminutes, but its relative contribution rises quickly towards smaller angular scales, with comparable power in both modes at a few arcseconds. The relevance of this effect with regard to the current cosmic shear surveys is discussed; it can not account for the apparent detection of a B-mode contribution on large angular scales in the cosmic shear analysis of van Waerbeke et al. (2002).},

title = {Probing dark energy with the shear-ratio geometric test},
abstract = {We adapt the Jain-Taylor (2003) shear-ratio geometric lensing method to measure the dark energy equation of state, w = pv/ρv and its time derivative from dark matter haloes in cosmologies with arbitrary spatial curvature. The full shear-ratio covariance matrix is calculated for lensed sources, including the intervening large-scale structure and photometric redshift errors as additional sources of noise, and a maximum likelihood method for applying the test is presented. Decomposing the lensing matter distribution into dark matter haloes we calculate the parameter covariance matrix for an arbitrary experiment. Combining with the expected results from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) we design an optimal survey for probing dark energy. This shows that a targeted survey imaging 60 of the largest clusters in a hemisphere with five-band optical photometric redshifts to a median galaxy depth of zm = 0.9 could measure w0 ≡ w(z = 0) to a marginal 1σ error of Δw0 = 0.5. We marginalize over all other parameters including wa, where the equation of state is parametrized in terms of scalefactor a as w(a) = w0 + wa(1 - a). For higher accuracy a large-scale photometric redshift survey is required, where the largest gain in signal arises from the numerous ~1014Msolar haloes corresponding to medium-sized galaxy clusters. Combined with the expected Planck Surveyor results, such a near-future five-band survey covering 10000 deg2 to zm = 0.7 could measure w0 to Δw0 = 0.075 and Δwa = 0.33. A stronger combined constraint is put on w measured at the pivot redshift zp = 0.27 of Δw(zp) = 0.0298. We compare and combine the geometric test with the cosmological and dark energy parameters measured from planned baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and supernova Type Ia experiments, and find that the geometric test results combine with a significant reduction in errors due to different degeneracies. A combination of geometric lensing, CMB and BAO experiments could achieve Δw0 = 0.047 and Δwa = 0.111 with a pivot redshift constraint of Δw(zp) = 0.020 at zp = 0.62. Simple relations are presented that show how our lensing results can be scaled to other telescope classes and survey parameters.},

abstract = {The systematic magnification of background sources by the weak gravitational-lensing effects of foreground matter, also called cosmic magnification, is becoming an efficient tool both for measuring cosmological parameters and for exploring the distribution of galaxies relative to the dark matter. We extend here the formalism of magnification statistics by estimating the contribution of second-order terms in the Taylor expansion of the magnification and show that the effect of these terms was previously underestimated. We test our analytical predictions against numerical simulations and demonstrate that including second-order terms allows the accuracy of magnification-related statistics to be substantially improved. We also show, however, that both numerical and analytical estimates can provide only lower bounds to real correlation functions, even in the weak lensing regime. We propose to use count-in-cells estimators rather than correlation functions for measuring cosmic magnification since they can more easily be related to correlations measured in numerical simulations.},

title = {New constraints on the evolution of the stellar-to-dark matter connection: a combined analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing, clustering, and stellar mass functions from z=0.2 to z=1},
abstract = {Using data from the COSMOS survey, we perform the first joint analysis of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy number densities. Carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter between stellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using a novel and self-consistent theoretical framework. Our results provide strong constraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) from z=0.2 to z=1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass scales as Mh M*^0.46 and that this scaling does not evolve significantly with redshift to z=1. We show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh/M*, varies from low to high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh/M*~27 at M*=4.5x10^10 Msun and Mh=1.2x10^12 Msun. This minimum is important for models of galaxy formation because it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the central galaxy has been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this minimum in terms of the "pivot stellar mass", M*piv, the "pivot halo mass", Mhpiv, and the "pivot ratio", (Mh/M*)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous analysis of a single data set, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends for both Mhpiv and M*piv. The pivot stellar mass decreases from M*piv=5.75+-0.13x10^10 Msun at z=0.88 to M*piv=3.55+-0.17x10^10 Msun at z=0.37. Intriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of Mhpiv leaves the pivot ratio constant with redshift at (Mh/M*)piv~27. We use simple arguments to show how this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching may ultimately depend on Mh/M* and not simply Mh, as is commonly assumed. We show that simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in the sites of star formation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and AGN feedback.},

title = {The removal of shear-ellipticity correlations from the cosmic shear signal. Influence of photometric redshift errors on the nulling technique},
abstract = {Aims: Cosmic shear, the gravitational lensing on cosmological scales, is regarded as one of the most powerful probes for revealing the properties of dark matter and dark energy. To fully utilize its potential, one has to be able to control systematic effects down to below the level of the statistical parameter errors. Particularly worrisome in this respect is the intrinsic alignment of galaxies, causing considerable parameter biases via correlations between the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and the gravitational shear, which mimic lensing. Since our understanding of the underlying processes of intrinsic alignment is still poor, purely geometrical methods are required to control this systematic. In an earlier work we proposed a nulling technique that downweights this systematic, only making use of its well-known redshift dependence. We assess the practicability of nulling, given realistic conditions on photometric redshift information. Methods: For several simplified intrinsic alignment models and a wide range of photometric redshift characteristics, we calculate an average bias before and after nulling. Modifications of the technique are introduced to optimize the bias removal and minimize the information loss by nulling. We demonstrate that one of the presented versions of nulling is close to optimal in terms of bias removal, given the high quality of photometric redshifts. Although the nulling weights depend on cosmology, being composed of comoving distances, we show that the technique is robust against an incorrect choice of cosmological parameters when calculating the weights. Moreover, general aspects such as the behavior of the Fisher matrix under parameter-dependent transformations and the range of validity of the bias formalism are discussed in an appendix. Results: Given excellent photometric redshift information, i.e. at least 10 bins with a dispersion σ_ph ≲ 0.03, a negligible fraction of catastrophic outliers, and precise knowledge about the bin-wise redshift distributions as characterized by a scatter of 0.001 or less on the median redshifts, one version of nulling is capable of reducing the shear-intrinsic ellipticity contamination by at least a factor of 100. Alternatively, we describe a robust nulling variant which suppresses the systematic signal by about 10 for a very broad range of photometric redshift configurations, provided basic information about σ_ph in each of ≳10 photometric redshift bins is available. Irrespective of the photometric redshift quality, a loss of statistical power is inherent to nulling, which amounts to a decrease of the order 50% in terms of our figure of merit under conservative assumptions.},

title = {Measuring dark energy properties with 3D cosmic shear},
abstract = {We present parameter estimation forecasts for present and future 3D cosmic shear surveys. We demonstrate in particular that, in conjunction with results from cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, the properties of dark energy can be estimated with very high precision with large-scale, fully 3D weak-lensing surveys. In particular, a five-band, 10000-deg2 ground-based survey of galaxies to a median redshift of zm = 0.7 could achieve 1σ marginal statistical errors, in combination with the constraints expected from the CMB Planck Surveyor, of Δw0 = 0.108 and Δwa = 0.099. We parametrize the redshift evolution of w by w(a) = w0 + wa(1 - a) where a is the scalefactor. Such a survey is achievable with a wide-field camera on a 4-m class telescope. The error on the value of w at an intermediate pivot redshift of z = 0.368 is constrained to Δw(z = 0.368) = 0.0175. We compare and combine the 3D weak-lensing constraints with the cosmological and dark energy parameters measured from planned baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and supernova Type Ia experiments, and find that 3D weak lensing significantly improves the marginalized errors on w0 and wa in combination, and provides constraints on w(z) at a unique redshift through the lensing effect. A combination of 3D weak-lensing, CMB and BAO experiments could achieve Δw0 = 0.037 and Δwa = 0.099. We also show how our results can be scaled to other telescopes and survey designs. Fully 3D weak shear analysis avoids the loss of information inherent in tomographic binning, and we also show that the sensitivity to systematic errors in photometric redshift is much less. In conjunction with the fact that the physics of lensing is very soundly based, the analysis here demonstrates that deep, wide-angle 3D weak-lensing surveys are extremely promising for measuring dark energy properties.},

title = {On Estimating Lyman-alpha Forest Correlations between Multiple Sightlines},
abstract = {The next frontier of Lyman-alpha forest studies is the reconstruction of 3D correlations from a dense sample of background sources. The measurement of 3D correlations has the potential to improve constraints on fundamental cosmological parameters, ionizing background models, and the reionization history. This study addresses the sensitivity of spectroscopic surveys to 3D correlations in the Lyman-alpha forest. We show that the sensitivity of a survey to this signal can be quantified by just a single number, a noise-weighted number density of sources on the sky. We quantify how the sensitivity of a spectroscopic quasar (or galaxy) survey scales as a function of its depth, area, and redshift. We propose a simple method for weighting sightlines with varying S/N levels to estimate the correlation function, and we show that this estimator perform nearly as well as the minimum variance quadratic estimator. In addition, we derive an easily computable expansion that converges to the minimum variance estimator and for which our suggested weights constitute the lowest order. Finally, we show that the sensitivity of a quasar survey to the flux correlation function is generally maximized if it observes each field just long enough to achieve S/N~2 in a 1 Angstrom pixel on an L_* quasar while acquiring spectra for all quasars with L > L_*: Little is gained by integrating longer on the same targets or by including fainter quasars. We quantify how these considerations relate to constraints on the angular diameter distance, the curvature of space-time, and the reionization history.},

For a complete sample of galaxies with log(Mstar/Msolar) > 10.5, where the majority show an early-type morphology, we find that the virial mass to stellar mass ratio is given by Mvir/Mstar = 53+13-16. Assuming a baryon fraction from the concordance cosmology, this corresponds to a stellar fraction of baryons in massive galaxies of Ω*b/Ωb = 0.10 +/- 0.03. Analysing the galaxy sample in different redshift slices, we find little or no evolution in the virial to stellar mass ratio, and place an upper limit of ~2.5 on the growth of massive galaxies through the conversion of gas into stars from z = 0.8 to the present day.},

The ellipticity of a background galaxy provides an estimate of the trace-free components of the tidal field. We present a technique for inverting this problem. The resulting surface density contains a strong, but incoherent, random component arising from the random intrinsic galaxy ellipticities. This can be removed by filtering. Our method is very similar in form to that of Tyson et al. (1990), and the latter is given a rigorous interpretation as a particular implementation of filtering. We present simulations to illustrate the application of the method.},

title = {Steps towards nonlinear cluster inversion through gravitational distortions. III. Including a redshift distribution of the sources.},
abstract = {In a series of previous papers we have considered the reconstruction of the surface mass density of a cluster of galaxies from images of lensed faint background galaxies. We showed that the reconstructed surface mass density is not uniquely determined, but that there exists a global invariance transformation that leaves the shape of the images of the lensed galaxies unchanged. Because of this, only lower limits on the total mass of a cluster can be derived if no further information besides image ellipticities are used. Throughout these papers we used the simplifying assumption that all sources are at the same redshift. In this paper we account for a redshift distribution of the faint galaxies, and in particular, some of these galaxies can lie in front of the cluster or can be cluster members. We show how the mass distribution of a cluster of galaxies can be obtained from images of these faint galaxies, if the redshift distribution of these galaxies is known. We demonstrate that for the reconstruction of non-critical clusters we need less information on the redshift distribution of the galaxies, i.e., we only need to know two or three moments of the distribution. We show that the mean mass density across the data field is still a free variable, i.e., there remains a global invariance transformation of the resulting mass density field. For non-critical clusters we can derive the transformation explicitly and it is similar to that derived previously for the case of a single redshift of the sources. We discuss several theoretical ideas to break the mass degeneracy; of those considered, we find that only the magnification effect on the number density of galaxy images can be used successfully in practice.},

abstract = {We report measurements of the mass density, Omega_M, and cosmological-constant energy density, Omega_Lambda, of the universe based on the analysis of 42 type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these supernovae, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fitted jointly with a set of supernovae from the Cal{\'a}n/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All supernova peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia light-curve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8Omega_M-0.6Omega_Lambda~-0.2+/-0.1 in the region of interest (Omega_M<~1.5). For a flat (Omega_M+Omega_Lambda=1) cosmology we find Omega^flat_M=0.28^+0.09_-0.08 (1 sigma statistical) ^+0.05_-0.04 (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Lambda=0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Lambda=0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero and positive, with a confidence of P(Lambda>0)=99%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is t^flat_0=14.9^+1.4_-1.1(0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Cal{\'a}n/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. Excluding those few supernovae that are outliers in color excess or fit residual does not significantly change the results. The conclusions are also robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the supernova peak magnitudes. We discuss and constrain, where possible, hypothetical alternatives to a cosmological constant.},

title = {Galaxy Cluster Gas Mass Fractions from Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect Measurements: Constraints on ΩM},
abstract = {Using sensitive centimeter-wave receivers mounted on the Owens Valley Radio Observatory and Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland-Association millimeter arrays, we have obtained interferometric measurements of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect toward massive galaxy clusters. We use the SZ data to determine the pressure distribution of the cluster gas and, in combination with published X-ray temperatures, to infer the gas mass and total gravitational mass of 18 clusters. The gas mass fraction, fg, is calculated for each cluster and is extrapolated to the fiducial radius r500 using the results of numerical simulations. The mean fg within r500 is 0.081+0.009-0.011 h-1100 (statistical uncertainty at 68% confidence level, assuming ΩM=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7). We discuss possible sources of systematic errors in the mean fg measurement. We derive an upper limit for ΩM from this sample under the assumption that the mass composition of clusters within r500 reflects the universal mass composition: ΩMh<=ΩB/fg. The gas mass fractions depend on cosmology through the angular diameter distance and the r500 correction factors. For a flat universe (ΩΛ≡1-ΩM) and h=0.7, we find the measured gas mass fractions are consistent with ΩM<0.40, at 68% confidence. Including estimates of the baryons contained in galaxies and the baryons which failed to become bound during the cluster formation process, we find ΩM~0.25.},

abstract = {The available probes of the large scale structure in the Universe have distinct properties: galaxies are a high resolution but biased tracer of mass, while weak lensing avoids such biases but, due to low signal-to-noise ratio, has poor resolution. We investigate reconstructing the projected density field using the complementarity of weak lensing and galaxy positions. We propose a maximum-probability reconstruction of the 2D lensing convergence with a likelihood term for shear data and a prior on the Fourier phases constructed from the galaxy positions. By considering only the phases of the galaxy field, we evade the unknown value of the bias and allow it to be calibrated by lensing on a mode-by-mode basis. By applying this method to a realistic simulated galaxy shear catalogue, we find that a weak prior on phases provides a good quality reconstruction down to scales beyond l=1000, far into the noise domain of the lensing signal alone.},

title = {Planck 2013 results. XV. CMB power spectra and likelihood},
abstract = {We present the Planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of the two-point correlation function of the CMB temperature fluctuations. We use this likelihood to derive the Planck CMB power spectrum over three decades in l, covering 2 <= l <= 2500. The main source of error at l <= 1500 is cosmic variance. Uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumental noise dominate the error budget at higher l's. For l < 50, our likelihood exploits all Planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 GHz through a physically motivated Bayesian component separation technique. At l >= 50, we employ a correlated Gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectra derived from the 100, 143 and 217 GHz channels. We validate our likelihood through an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact of residual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters. We find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residuals of a few uK^2 at l <= 1000. We compare our results with foreground-cleaned CMB maps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 GHz Planck map, and find broad agreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. The best-fit LCDM cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary Planck polarisation spectra. The standard LCDM cosmology is well constrained by Planck by l <= 1500. For example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1. Considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indication of significant departures from the LCDM framework. Finally, we report a tension between the best-fit LCDM model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a power deficit of 5-10% at l <~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. We do not elaborate further on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our most puzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset. (Abridged)},

title = {Detection of weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure},
abstract = {We report a detection of the coherent distortion of faint galaxies arising from gravitational lensing by foreground structures. This `cosmic shear' is potentially the most direct measure of the mass power spectrum, as it is unaffected by poorly justified assumptions made concerning the biasing of the distribution. Our detection is based on an initial imaging study of 14 separated 8×16arcmin2 fields observed in good, homogeneous conditions with the prime focus EEV-CCD camera of the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope. We detect an rms shear of 1.6per cent in 8×8arcmin2 cells, with a significance of 3.4σ. We carefully justify this detection by quantifying various systematic effects and carrying out extensive simulations of the recovery of the shear signal from artificial images defined according to measured instrument characteristics. We also verify our detection by computing the cross-correlation between the shear in adjacent cells. Including (Gaussian) cosmic variance, we measure the shear variance to be (0.016)2+/-(0.012)2+/-(0.006)2, where these 1σ errors correspond to statistical and systematic uncertainties, respectively. Our measurements are consistent with the predictions of cluster-normalized cold dark matter (CDM) models (within 1σ) but a Cosmic Background Explorer normalized standard cold dark matter model is ruled out at the 3.0σ level. For the currently favoured ΛCDM model (with Ωm=0.3), our measurement provides a normalization of the mass power spectrum of σ8=1.5+/-0.5, fully consistent with that derived from cluster abundances. Our result demonstrates that ground-based telescopes can, with adequate care, be used to constrain the mass power spectrum on various scales. The present results are limited mainly by cosmic variance, which can be overcome in the near future with more observations.},

title = {Quantifying the effect of baryon physics on weak lensing tomography},
abstract = {We use matter power spectra from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to quantify the effect of baryon physics on the weak gravitational lensing shear signal. The simulations consider a number of processes, such as radiative cooling, star formation, supernovae and feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Van Daalen et al. used the same simulations to show that baryon physics, in particular the strong feedback that is required to solve the overcooling problem, modifies the matter power spectrum on scales relevant for cosmological weak lensing studies. As a result, the use of power spectra from dark matter simulations can lead to significant biases in the inferred cosmological parameters. We show that the typical biases are much larger than the precision with which future missions aim to constrain the dark energy equation of state, w0. For instance, the simulation with AGN feedback, which reproduces X-ray and optical properties of groups of galaxies, gives rise to a ˜40 per cent bias in w0. We also explore the effect of baryon physics on constraints on Ωm, σ8, the running of the spectral index, the mass of the neutrinos and models of warm dark matter. We demonstrate that the modification of the power spectrum is dominated by groups and clusters of galaxies, the effect of which can be modelled. We consider an approach based on the popular halo model and show that simple modifications can capture the main features of baryonic feedback. Despite its simplicity, we find that our model, when calibrated on the simulations, is able to reduce the bias in w0 to a level comparable to the size of the statistical uncertainties for a Euclid-like mission. While observations of the gas and stellar fractions as a function of halo mass can be used to calibrate the model, hydrodynamic simulations will likely still be needed to extend the observed scaling relations down to halo masses of 1012 h-1 M⊙.},

title = {Understanding the nature of luminous red galaxies (LRGs): Connecting LRGs to central and satellite subhalos},
abstract = {We develop a novel abundance matching method to construct a mock catalog of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), using catalogs of halos and subhalos in N-body simulations for a Lambda-dominated, cold dark matter model. Motivated by observations suggesting that LRGs are passively-evolving, massive early-type galaxies with a typical age >5Gyr, we assume that simulated halos at z=2 (z2-halo) are progenitors for LRG-host subhalos observed today, we label the most tightly bound particles in each progenitor z2-halo as LRG "stars". We then identify the subhalos containing these stars to z=0.3 (SDSS redshift) in descending order of the masses of z2-halos until the comoving number density of the matched subhalos becomes comparable to the measured number density of SDSS LRGs, n_LRG=10^{-4} (h/Mpc)^3. Our only free parameter is the number density of halos identified at z=2 and this parameter is fixed to match the observed number density at z = 0.3. By tracing subsequent merging and assembly histories of each progenitor z2-halo, we can directly compute, from {\$}N{\$}-body simulations, the distributions of central and satellite LRGs and their internal motions in each host halo at z=0.3. While the SDSS LRGs are galaxies selected by the magnitude and color cuts from the SDSS images and are not necessarily a stellar-mass-selected sample, our mock catalog reproduces a host of SDSS measurements: the halo occupation distribution for central and satellite LRGs, the projected auto-correlation function of LRGs, the cross-correlation of LRGs with shapes of background galaxies (LRG-galaxy weak lensing), and the nonlinear redshift-space distortion effect, the Finger-of-God effect, in the angle-averaged, redshift-space power spectrum.},

title = {An Implementation of Bayesian Lensing Shear Measurement},
abstract = {The Bayesian gravitational shear estimation algorithm developed by Bernstein and Armstrong (2014) can potentially be used to overcome noise bias and recover shear using very low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) galaxy images. In that work the authors confirmed the method is sufficiently unbiased for planned surveys (fractional error less than 2 x 10^{-3}) in a simplified demonstration, but no test was performed on images. Here I present a full implementation for fitting models to galaxy images, including the effects of a point spread function (PSF) and pixelization. I tested the implementation using simulated galaxy images modeled as Sersic profiles with n=1 (exponential) and n=4 (De Vaucouleurs'), convolved with a PSF and a flat pixel response function. I used a round Gaussian model for the PSF to avoid potential PSF-fitting errors. I simulated galaxies with mean observed, post-PSF full-width at half maximum equal to approximately 1.2 times that of the PSF, with log-normal scatter. I also drew fluxes from a log-normal distribution. I produced independent simulations, each with pixel noise tuned to produce different mean S/N ranging from 10-1000. I applied a constant shear to all images. I fit the simulated images to a model with the true Sersic index to avoid modeling biases. I recovered the input shear with fractional error less than 2 x 10^{-3} in all cases, confirming that, in these controlled conditions, the method is sufficiently unbiased for planned surveys.},

It is based on the covariant approach in combination with a frame that is purely given by the metric, the normal frame. As an example, we apply this framework to the LCDM model, extending the usual first order conditions on the metric potentials to second order. We argue that working in the normal frame is not only a practical choice but one that closely resembles our actual situation as observers. In this frame, effective pressures and anisotropic stresses appear at second order in perturbation theory, even for dust. We quantify this effect and compare it, for illustration, with the pressure of a generic clustering dark energy fluid and the anisotropic stress in the DGP model. Besides, we also discuss the effect of a mismatch of the potentials on the determination of galaxy bias.},

abstract = {We present cosmological constraints from 2D weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) which spans 154 deg2 in five optical bands. Using accurate photometric redshifts and measured shapes for 4.2 million galaxies between redshifts of 0.2 and 1.3, we compute the 2D cosmic shear correlation function over angular scales ranging between 0.8 and 350 arcmin. Using non-linear models of the dark-matter power spectrum, we constrain cosmological parameters by exploring the parameter space with Population Monte Carlo sampling. The best constraints from lensing alone are obtained for the small-scale density-fluctuations amplitude σ8 scaled with the total matter density Ωm. For a flat Λcold dark matter (ΛCDM) model we obtain σ8(Ωm/0.27)0.6 = 0.79 $\pm$ 0.03. We combine the CFHTLenS data with 7-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP7), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO): SDSS-III (BOSS) and a Hubble Space Telescope distance-ladder prior on the Hubble constant to get joint constraints. For a flat ΛCDM model, we find Ωm = 0.283 $\pm$ 0.010 and σ8 = 0.813 $\pm$ 0.014. In the case of a curved wCDM universe, we obtain Ωm = 0.27 $\pm$ 0.03, σ8 = 0.83 $\pm$ 0.04, w0 = -1.10 $\pm$ 0.15 and ΩK = 0.006+ 0.006- 0.004. We calculate the Bayesian evidence to compare flat and curved ΛCDM and dark-energy CDM models. From the combination of all four probes, we find models with curvature to be at moderately disfavoured with respect to the flat case. A simple dark-energy model is indistinguishable from ΛCDM. Our results therefore do not necessitate any deviations from the standard cosmological model.},

title = {Noise properties of gravitational lens mass reconstruction},
abstract = {Gravitational lensing is potentially able to observe mass-selected halos, and to measure the projected cluster mass function. An optimal mass-selection requires a quantitative understanding of the noise behavior in mass maps. This paper is an analysis of the noise properties in mass maps reconstructed using a maximum likelihood method. The noise power spectrum and the mass error bars are derived as a straightforward extension of the Kaiser {\&} Squires (1993) algorithm to the case of a correlated noise. A very good agreement is found between these calculations and the noise properties observed in maximum likelihood mass reconstructions limited to simulated non-critical clusters of galaxies. In a second part, I show that the statistic of peaks in the noise follows accurately the peak statistics of a two-dimensional Gaussian random field (using the BBKS technics) if the smoothing aperture contains enough galaxies. This analysis provides a procedure to derive the significance of any mass peak as a function of its amplitude and its profile. It is demonstrated that, to a very good approximation, a mass map is the sum of the lensing signal plus a 2D gaussian random noise, which means that a detailled quantitative analysis of the structures in mass maps can be done. A direct application is the measurement of the projected mass function in wide field lensing surveys, down to small mass halos which are individually undetectable, this is the subject of a forthcoming work.},

The alignment of Luminous Red Galaxies, detected unambiguously in observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, can be reproduced by the linear tidal alignment model of Hirata {\&} Seljak (2004) on large scales. In this work, we explore the cosmological information encoded in the intrinsic alignments of red galaxies. We make forecasts for the ability of current and future spectroscopic surveys to constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the cross-correlation function of intrinsic alignments and the galaxy density field. For the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, we find that the BAO signal in the intrinsic alignments is marginally significant with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.8 and 2.2 with the current LOWZ and CMASS samples of galaxies, respectively, and increasing to 2.3 and 2.7 once the survey is completed. For the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and for a spectroscopic survey following the EUCLID redshift selection function, we find signal-to-noise ratios of 12 and 15, respectively. Local type primordial non-Gaussianity, parametrized by fNL = 10, is only marginally significant in the intrinsic alignments signal with signal-to-noise ratios < 2 for the three surveys considered.},

abstract = {With a primary goal of conducting precision weak-lensing measurements from space, the COSMOS survey has imaged the largest contiguous area observed by Hubble Space Telescope to date, using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). This is the first paper in a series in which we describe our strategy for addressing the various technical challenges in the production of weak-lensing measurements from COSMOS data. We first construct a source catalog from 575 ACS/WFC tiles (1.64 deg2) subsampled at a pixel scale of 0.03". Defects and diffraction spikes are carefully removed, leaving a total of 1.2×106 objects to a limiting magnitude of F814W=26.5. This catalog is made publicly available. Multiwavelength follow-up observations of the COSMOS field provide photometric redshifts for 73% of the source galaxies in the lensing catalog. We analyze and discuss the COSMOS redshift distribution and show broad agreement with other surveys to z~1. Our next step is to measure the shapes of galaxies and correct them for the distortion induced by the time-varying ACS point-spread function and for charge transfer efficiency (CTE) effects. Simulated images are used to derive the shear susceptibility factors that are necessary in transforming shape measurements into unbiased shear estimators. For every galaxy we derive a shape measurement error and utilize this quantity to extract the intrinsic shape noise of the galaxy sample. Interestingly, our results indicate that intrinsic shape noise varies little with size, magnitude, or redshift. Representing a number density of 66 galaxies per arcmin2, the final COSMOS weak-lensing catalog contains 3.9×105 galaxies with accurate shape measurements. The properties of the COSMOS weak-lensing catalog described throughout this paper will provide key input numbers for the preparation and design of next-generation wide field space missions.},

We include in this approach galaxy cosmic shear and galaxy intrinsic alignments, CMB deflection, CMB temperature and CMB polarisation data; including the inter-datum power spectra between all quantities. We apply this to forecasting cosmological parameter errors for CMB and imaging surveys and show that the additional covariance between the CMB and ellipticity measurements can improve galaxy intrinsic alignment measurements by a factor of two, and dark energy equation of state measurements by thirty percent. We present predictions for Euclid-like, KiDS, ACTPoL, and CoRE-like experiments and show that the combination of cosmic shear and the CMB, from Euclid-like and CoRE-like experiments, can measure the sum of neutrino masses with an error of 0.02 eV, and the dark energy equation of state with an error on w0 of less than 0.01.},

CFHTLenS comprises 154 deg2 of multi-colour optical data from the CFHT Legacy Survey, with lensing measurements being made in the i' band to a depth i'AB < 24.7, for galaxies with signal-to-noise ratio νSN ≳ 10. The method is based on the lensfit algorithm described in earlier papers, but here we describe a full analysis pipeline that takes into account the properties of real surveys. The method creates pixel-based models of the varying point spread function (PSF) in individual image exposures. It fits PSF-convolved two-component (disc plus bulge) models to measure the ellipticity of each galaxy, with Bayesian marginalization over model nuisance parameters of galaxy position, size, brightness and bulge fraction. The method allows optimal joint measurement of multiple, dithered image exposures, taking into account imaging distortion and the alignment of the multiple measurements. We discuss the effects of noise bias on the likelihood distribution of galaxy ellipticity. Two sets of image simulations that mirror the observed properties of CFHTLenS have been created to establish the method's accuracy and to derive an empirical correction for the effects of noise bias.},

title = {Cluster Abundance in f(R) Gravity Models},
abstract = {As one of the most powerful probes of cosmological structure formation, the abundance of massive galaxy clusters is a sensitive probe of modifications to gravity on cosmological scales. In this paper, we present results from N-body simulations of a general class of f(R) models, which self-consistently solve the non-linear field equation for the enhanced forces. Within this class we vary the amplitude of the field, which controls the range of the enhanced gravitational forces, both at the present epoch and as a function of redshift. Most models in the literature can be mapped onto the parameter space of this class. Focusing on the abundance of massive dark matter halos, we compare the simulation results to a simple spherical collapse model. Current constraints lie in the large-field regime, where the chameleon mechanism is not important. In this regime, the spherical collapse model works equally well for a wide range of models and can serve as a model-independent tool for placing constraints on f(R) gravity from cluster abundance. Using these results, we show how constraints from the observed local abundance of X-ray clusters on a specific f(R) model can be mapped onto other members of this general class of models.},

title = {The Faint End of the Luminosity Function and Low Surface Brightness Galaxies},
abstract = {SHELS (Smithsonian Hectospec Lensing Survey) is a dense redshift survey covering a 4 square degree region to a limiting R = 20.6. In the construction of the galaxy catalog and in the acquisition of spectroscopic targets, we paid careful attention to the survey completeness for low surface brightness galaxies. Thus, although the survey covers a small area, it is a robust basis for computation of the slope of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function. We calculate the faint end slope in the R-band for the subset of SHELS galaxies with redshifts in the range 0.02 <= z < 0.1, SHELS0.1. This sample contains 532 galaxies with R < 20.6 and with a median surface brightness within the half light radius of SB(50,R) = 21.82 mag per square arcsec. We used this sample to make one of the few direct measurements of the dependence of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function on surface brightness. For the sample as a whole the faint end slope, alpha = -1.31 +- 0.04, is consistent with both the Blanton et al. (2005b) analysis of the SDSS and the Liu et al. (2008) analysis of the COSMOS field. This consistency is impressive given the very different approaches of these three surveys. A magnitude limited sample of 135 galaxies with central surface brightness, SB(50,R) >= 22.5 mag per square arcsec, is unique to SHELS0.1. The faint end slope is alpha(22.5) = -1.52 +- 0.16. SHELS0.1 shows that low surface brightness objects dominate the faint end slope of the luminosity function in the field, underscoring the importance of carefully controlled surface brightness limits in evaluating measurements of the faint end slope and its evolution.},

abstract = {We present the findings of our weak-lensing study of a sample of 116 CNOC2 galaxy groups. The lensing signal is used to estimate the mass-to-light ratio of these galaxy groups. The best-fit isothermal sphere model to our lensing data has an Einstein radius of 0.88"+/-0.12", which corresponds to a shear-weighted velocity dispersion of 245+/-18 km s-1. The mean mass-to-light ratio within 1 h-1 Mpc is 185+/-28 h Msolar L-1Bsolar and is independent of radius from the group center. The signal-to-noise ratio of the shear measurement is sufficient to split the sample into subsets of ``poor'' and ``rich'' galaxy groups. The poor galaxy groups were found to have an average velocity dispersion of 193+/-38 km s-1 and a mass-to-light ratio of 134+/-26 h Msolar L-1Bsolar, while the rich galaxy groups have a velocity dispersion of 270+/-39 km s-1 and a mass-to-light ratio of 278+/-42 h Msolar L-1Bsolar, similar to the mass-to-light ratio of clusters. This steep increase in the mass-to-light ratio as a function of mass suggests that the mass scale of ~1013 Msolar is where the transition between the actively star-forming field environment and the passively evolving cluster environment occurs. This is the first such detection from weak lensing.

title = {Combining Probes of Large-Scale Structure with CosmoLike},
abstract = {Developing accurate analysis techniques to combine various probes of cosmology is essential to tighten constraints on cosmological parameters and to check for inconsistencies in our model of the Universe. In this paper we develop a joint analysis framework for six different second-order statistics calculated from three tracers of the dark matter density field, namely galaxy position, shear, and magnification. We extend a data compression scheme developed in the context of shear-shear statistics (the so-called COSEBIs) to the other five second-order statistics, thereby significantly reducing the number of data points in the joint data vector. We use CosmoLike, a newly developed software framework for joint likelihood analyses, to forecast parameter constraints for the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The simulated MCMCs cover a five dimensional cosmological parameter space comparing the information content of the individual probes to several combined probes (CP) data vectors. Given the significant correlations of these second-order statistics we model all cross terms in the covariance matrix; furthermore we go beyond the Gaussian covariance approximation and use the halo model to include higher order correlations of the density field. We find that adding magnification information (including cross probes with shear and clustering) noticeably increases the information content and that the correct modeling of the covariance (i.e., accounting for non-Gaussianity and cross terms) is essential for accurate likelihood contours from the CP data vector. We also identify several nulltests based on the degeneracy of magnification and shear statistics which can be used to quantify the contamination of data sets by astrophysical systematics and/or calibration issues.},

title = {Bayesian Galaxy Shape Measurement for Weak Lensing Surveys -II. Application to Simulations},
abstract = {We extend the Bayesian model fitting shape measurement method presented in Miller et al. (2007) and use the method to estimate the shear from the Shear TEsting Programme simulations (STEP). The method uses a fast model fitting algorithm which uses realistic galaxy profiles and analytically marginalises over the position and amplitude of the model by doing the model fitting in Fourier space. This is used to find the full posterior probability in ellipticity so that the shear can be estimated in a fully Bayesian way. The Bayesian shear estimation allows measurement bias arising from the presence of random noise to be removed. In this paper we introduce an iterative algorithm that can be used to estimate the intrinsic ellipticity prior and show that this is accurate and stable. By using the method to estimate the shear from the STEP1 simulations we find the method to have a shear bias of m ~ 0.005 and a variation in shear offset with PSF type of sigma_c ~ 0.0002. These values are smaller than for any method presented in the STEP1 publication that behaves linearly with shear. Using the method to estimate the shear from the STEP2 simulations we find than the shear bias and offset are m ~ 0.002 and c ~ -0.0007 respectively. In addition we find that the bias and offset are stable to changes in magnitude and size of the galaxies. Such biases should yield any cosmological constraints from future weak lensing surveys robust to systematic effects in shape measurement.},

title = {CFHTLenS: the relation between galaxy dark matter haloes and baryons from weak gravitational lensing},
abstract = {We present a study of the relation between dark matter halo mass and the baryonic content of their host galaxies, quantified through galaxy luminosity and stellar mass. Our investigation uses 154 deg2 of Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) lensing and photometric data, obtained from the CFHT Legacy Survey. To interpret the weak lensing signal around our galaxies, we employ a galaxy-galaxy lensing halo model which allows us to constrain the halo mass and the satellite fraction. Our analysis is limited to lenses at redshifts between 0.2 and 0.4, split into a red and a blue sample. We express the relationship between dark matter halo mass and baryonic observable as a power law with pivot points of 10^{11} h_{70}^{-2} L_{{⊙}} and 2× 10^{11} h_{70}^{-2} M_{{⊙}} for luminosity and stellar mass, respectively. For the luminosity-halo mass relation, we find a slope of 1.32 $\pm$ 0.06 and a normalization of 1.19^{+0.06}_{-0.07}× 10^{13} h_{70}^{-1} M_{{⊙}} for red galaxies, while for blue galaxies the best-fitting slope is 1.09^{+0.20}_{-0.13} and the normalization is 0.18^{+0.04}_{-0.05}× 10^{13} h_{70}^{-1} M_{{⊙}}. Similarly, we find a best-fitting slope of 1.36^{+0.06}_{-0.07} and a normalization of 1.43^{+0.11}_{-0.08}× 10^{13} h_{70}^{-1} M_{{⊙}} for the stellar mass-halo mass relation of red galaxies, while for blue galaxies the corresponding values are 0.98^{+0.08}_{-0.07} and 0.84^{+0.20}_{-0.16}× 10^{13} h_{70}^{-1} M_{{⊙ }}. All numbers convey the 68 per cent confidence limit. For red lenses, the fraction which are satellites inside a larger halo tends to decrease with luminosity and stellar mass, with the sample being nearly all satellites for a stellar mass of 2× 109 h_{70}^{-2} M_{{⊙}}. The satellite fractions are generally close to zero for blue lenses, irrespective of luminosity or stellar mass. This, together with the shallower relation between halo mass and baryonic tracer, is a direct confirmation from galaxy-galaxy lensing that blue galaxies reside in less clustered environments than red galaxies. We also find that the halo model, while matching the lensing signal around red lenses well, is prone to overpredicting the large-scale signal for faint and less massive blue lenses. This could be a further indication that these galaxies tend to be more isolated than assumed.},

title = {Combining Probes of Large-Scale Structure},
abstract = {Developing accurate analysis techniques to combine various probes of cosmology is essential to tighten constraints on cosmological parameters and to check for inconsistencies in our model of the Universe. In this paper we develop a joint analysis framework for six different second-order statistics of tracers of the dark matter density field, namely galaxy position, shear, and magnification. We extend a data compression scheme developed in the context of shear-shear statistics (the so-called COSEBIs) to the other five second-order statistics, thereby significantly reducing the number of data points in the joint data vector. We simulate a likelihood analysis for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) in a five dimensional cosmological parameter space (plus basic parametrization for bias and correlation parameter) comparing the information content of the individual probes to several combined probes (CP) data vectors. Given the significant correlations of these second-order statistics we model all cross terms in the covariance matrix; furthermore we go beyond the Gaussian covariance approximation and use the halo model to include higher order correlations of the density field. We find that modeling both, Non-Gaussianity and cross terms, is essential for accurate likelihood contours from the CP data vector; assuming Gaussian errors or uncorrelated probes impacts the contours at a similar level as assuming perfect knowledge of galaxy bias. We also identify several nulltests based on the degeneracy of magnification and shear statistics which can be used to quantify the contamination of data sets by astrophysical systematics and/or calibration issues.},

abstract = {[ABRIDGED] The weak gravitational lensing effect is used to infer matter density fluctuations within the field-of-view of the Garching-Bonn Deep Survey (GaBoDS). This information is employed for a statistical comparison of the galaxy distribution to the total matter distribution. The result of this comparison is expressed by means of the linear bias factor, b, the ratio of density fluctuations, and the correlation factor {\$}r{\$} between density fluctuations. The total galaxy sample is divided into three sub-samples using R-band magnitudes and the weak lensing analysis is applied separately for each sub-sample. Together with the photometric redshifts from the related COMBO-17 survey we estimate the typical mean redshifts of these samples with {\$}\bar{z}=0.35, 0.47, 0.61{\$}, respectively. For all three samples, a slight galaxy anti-bias, b~0.8+-0.1, on scales of a few Mpc/h is found; the bias factor shows evidence for a slight scale-dependence. The correlation between galaxy and (dark) matter distribution is high, r~0.6+-0.2, indicating a non-linear or/and stochastic biasing relation between matter and galaxies. Between the three samples no significant evolution with redshift is found.},

title = {Which galaxy property is the best indicator of its host dark matter halo properties?},
abstract = {In this work we investigate the link between galaxy velocity dispersion, mass and other properties (color, morphology) with the properties of dark matter halos by comparing the clustering of galaxies at both fixed mass and velocity dispersion. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to define a volume limited sample of massive galaxies complete in both stellar mass (>6e10 Msun) and velocity dispersion (>75 km/s). Using this sample we show that at fixed velocity dispersion there is no dependence of the clustering amplitude on stellar or dynamical mass. Conversely when stellar or dynamical mass are fixed there is a clear dependence of the clustering amplitude on velocity dispersion with higher dispersion galaxies showing a higher clustering amplitude. We also show that whilst when stellar or dynamical mass are fixed there remains a dependence of clustering amplitude on morphology, there is no such dependency when dispersion is fixed. However, we do see a dependence of the clustering amplitude on color when both mass and dispersion are fixed. Despite this, even when we restrict our samples to only elliptical or red galaxies the relationship between dispersion and clustering amplitude at fixed mass remains. It seems likely that the residual correlation with color is driven by satellite galaxies in massive halos being redder at fixed dispersion. The lack of a similar morphology dependence implies that the mechanism turning satellites red is not changing their morphology. Our central result is that velocity dispersion is more closely related to the clustering amplitude of galaxies than either stellar or dynamical mass. This implies that velocity dispersion is more tightly correlated with the halo properties that determine clustering, either halo mass or age, and supports the notion that the star formation history of a galaxy is more closely related to its halo properties than its overall mass.},

abstract = {In these lectures I cover a number of topics in cosmological data analysis. I concentrate on general techniques which are common in cosmology, or techniques which have been developed in a cosmological context. In fact they have very general applicability, for problems in which the data are interpreted in the context of a theoretical model, and thus lend themselves to a Bayesian treatment. We consider the general problem of estimating parameters from data, and consider how one can use Fisher matrices to analyse survey designs before any data are taken, to see whether the survey will actually do what is required. We outline numerical methods for estimating parameters from data, including Monte Carlo Markov Chains and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. We also look at Model Selection, which covers various scenarios such as whether an extra parameter is preferred by the data, or answering wider questions such as which theoretical framework is favoured, using General Relativity and braneworld gravity as an example. These notes are not a literature review, so there are relatively few references.},

title = {Cosmology without cosmic variance},
abstract = {We examine the improvements in constraints on the linear growth factor G and its derivative f= d ln G/d ln a that are available from the combination of a large-scale galaxy redshift survey with a weak gravitational lensing survey of background sources. In the linear perturbation theory limit, the bias-modulation method of McDonald {\&} Seljak allows one to distinguish the real-space galaxy clustering from the peculiar velocity signal in each Fourier mode. The ratio of lensing signal to galaxy clustering in transverse modes yields the bias factor b of each galaxy subset, hence calibrating the conversion from galaxy real-space density to matter density in every mode. In combination these techniques permit measure of the growth rate f in each Fourier mode. In principle this yields a measure of the growth rate that is free of sample variance, i.e. the uncertainty in f can be reduced without bound by increasing the number of redshifts obtained within a finite survey volume. In practice, the gain from the absence of sample variance is bounded by the limited range of bias modulation among dark matter haloes. None the less, the addition of background weak lensing data to a redshift survey increases information on G and f by an amount equivalent to a 10-fold increase in the volume of a standard redshift-space distortion measurement - if the lensing signal can be measured to sub-per cent accuracy. This argues that a combined lensing and redshift survey over a common low-redshift volume of the Universe is a more powerful test of general relativity than an isolated redshift survey over larger volume at high redshift, especially as surveys begin to cover most of the available sky. An example case is that a survey of ≈106 halo redshifts over half the sky in the redshift range z= 0.5 $\pm$ 0.05 can determine the growth exponent γ for the model f=Ωγm to an accuracy of $\pm$0.015, using only modes with k < 0.1 h Mpc-1, but only if a weak lensing survey is conducted in concert.},

title = {Have Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations in the galaxy distribution really been measured?},
abstract = {Recent publications claim that there is no convincing evidence for measurements of the baryonic acoustic (BAO) feature in galaxy samples using either monopole or radial information. Different claims seem contradictory: data is either not consistent with the BAO model or data is consistent with both the BAO model and featureless models without BAO. We investigate this point with a set of 216 realistic mock galaxy catalogs extracted from MICE7680, one of the largest volume dark matter simulation run to date, with a volume of 1300 cubical gigaparsecs. Our mocks cover similar volume, densities and bias as the real galaxies and provide 216 realizations of the Lambda or w=-1 Cold Dark Matter (wCDM) BAO model. We find that only 20% of the mocks show a statistically significant (3 sigma) preference for the true (input) wCDM BAO model as compared to a featureless (non-physical) model without BAO. Thus the volume of current galaxy samples is not yet large enough to claim that the BAO feature has been detected. Does this mean that we can not locate the BAO position? Using a simple (non optimal) algorithm we show that in 50% (100%) of the mocks we can find the BAO position within 5% (20%) of the true value. These two findings are not in contradiction: the former is about model selection, the later is about parameter fitting within a model. We conclude that current monopole and radial BAO measurements can be used as standard rulers if we assume wCDM type of models.},

Many of the theories giving rise to eternal inflation predict that we have causal access to collisions with other bubble universes, opening up the possibility that observational cosmology can probe the dynamics of eternal inflation. We present the first observational search for the effects of bubble collisions, using cosmic microwave background data from the WMAP satellite. Using a modular algorithm that is designed to avoid a posteriori selection effects, we find four features on the CMB sky that are consistent with being bubble collisions. If this evidence is corroborated by upcoming data from the Planck satellite, we will be able to gain insight into the possible existence of the multiverse.},

abstract = {Dust emission at submillimetre wavelengths allows us to trace the early phases of star formation in the Universe. In order to understand the physical processes involved in this mode of star formation, it is essential to gain knowledge about the dark matter structures - most importantly their masses - that submillimetre galaxies live in. Here we use the magnification effect of gravitational lensing to determine the average mass and dust content of submillimetre galaxies with 250 μm flux densities of S250 > 15 mJy selected using data from the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey. The positions of hundreds of submillimetre foreground lenses are cross-correlated with the positions of background Lyman-break galaxies at z ˜ 3-5 selected using optical data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. We detect a cross-correlation signal at the 7σ level over a sky area of 1 deg2, with ˜80 per cent of this signal being due to magnification, whereas the remaining ˜20 per cent comes from dust extinction. Adopting some simple assumptions for the dark matter and dust profiles and the redshift distribution enables us to estimate the average mass of the haloes hosting the submillimetre galaxies to be log 10[M200/M⊙] = 13.17+ 0.05- 0.08(stat.) and their average dust mass fraction (at radii of >10 kpc) to be Mdust/M200 ≈ 6 × 10-5. This supports the picture that submillimetre galaxies are dusty, forming stars at a high rate, reside in massive group-sized haloes and are a crucial phase in the assembly and evolution of structure in the Universe.},

The main imaging area overlaps the planned Sunyaev-Zel'dovich survey of the South Pole Telescope. The idea behind DES is to use four distinct and largely independent methods to probe the properties of dark energy: baryon oscillations of the power spectrum, abundance and spatial distribution of clusters, weak gravitational lensing, and Type Ia supernovae. This white paper outlines, in broad terms, some of the theoretical issues associated with the first three of these probes (the issues for supernovae are mostly different in character), and with the general task of characterizing dark energy and distinguishing it from alternative explanations for cosmic acceleration. A companion white paper discusses the kind of numerical simulations and other theoretical tools that will be needed to address the these issues and to create mock catalogs that allow end-to-end tests of analysis procedures. Although we have been thinking about these problems in the specific context of DES, many of them are also relevant to other planned dark energy studies. },

title = {QSO lensing magnification: a comparison of 2QZ and Sloan Digital Sky Survey results},
abstract = {The lensing magnification of background QSOs by foreground galaxies and clusters is a powerful probe of the mass density of the Universe and the power spectrum of mass clustering. However, the observational results in this area have been controversial. In particular, the results of Myers et al. from the 2dF QSO survey suggested that a strong anticorrelation effect at g < 21 is seen for both galaxies and clusters which implied that galaxies are antibiased (b ~ 0.1) on small scales at a higher level than predicted by the standard cosmology whereas the results of Scranton et al. from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) suggested that the effect was much smaller (b ~ 1) and in line with standard expectations. We first cross-correlate the SDSS photo-z, g < 21, 1.0 < zp < 2.2 QSOs with g < 21 galaxies and clusters in the same areas. The anticorrelation found is somewhat less than the results of Myers et al. based on 2QZ QSOs. But contamination of the QSOs by low-redshift narrow emission-line galaxies and QSOs can cause underestimation of the anticorrelation lensing signal. Correcting for such low-redshift contamination at the levels indicated by our spectroscopic checks suggests that the effect is generally small for QSO cross-correlations with g < 21 galaxies but may be an issue for fainter galaxy samples. Thus when this correction is applied to the photo-z QSO sample of Scranton et al. the anticorrelation increases and the agreement with the 2QZ results of Myers et al. is improved. When we also take into account the fainter r < 21 galaxy limit of Scranton et al. as opposed to g < 21 for Myers et al., the two observational results appear to be in very good agreement. This therefore leaves open the question of why the theoretical interpretations are so different for these analyses. We note that the results of Guimaraes, Myers and Shanks based on mock catalogues from the Hubble Volume simulation strongly suggest that QSO lensing at the levels detected by both Myers et al. and now Scranton et al. is incompatible with a galaxy bias of b ~ 1 in the standard cosmological model. If the QSO lensing results are correct then the consequences for cosmology may be significant.},

annote = {Conclusion - The Myers and Scranton results differ for two reasons:
1. - The simplest - The two use different galaxy samples therefore different measures of for example alpha (although this in particular is not mentioned)
2. - The authors suggest that Scranton et al. do not properly account for contamination due to redshift errors - thus some of the anti correlation in their measured results would have been removed from IC contamination. The authors claim that properly accounting for this increases the anti correlation in line wit Myers et al.

Outstanding - Myers et al require b~0.1 to physically explain anti correlation (remember b(alpha-1) for cross terms which are measured) but Scranton et al require b = 1. They note that other work confirms that b = 1 overestimates magnification signal by a factor of 10.},

title = {Cosmology from Supernova Magnification Maps},
abstract = {High-z Type Ia supernovae are expected to be gravitationally lensed by the foreground distribution of large-scale structure. The resulting magnification of supernovae is statistically measurable, and the angular correlation of the magnification pattern directly probes the integrated mass density along the line of sight. Measurements of the cosmic magnification of supernovae therefore complement measurements of galaxy shear in providing a direct measure of the clustering of the dark matter. As the surface density of supernovae is typically much smaller than that of sheared galaxies, the two-point correlation function of lensed Type Ia supernovae suffers from significantly increased shot noise. Nevertheless, we find that the magnification map of a large sample of supernovae provides an important cosmological tool. For example, a search over 20 deg2 over 5 years leading to a sample of ~10,000 supernovae would measure the angular power spectrum of cosmic magnification with a cumulative signal-to-noise ratio of ~20. This detection can be further improved once the supernova distance measurements are cross-correlated with measurements of the foreground galaxy distribution. The magnification maps made using supernovae can be used for important cross-checks with traditional lensing shear statistics obtained in the same fields and can help to control systematics.},

When normalized to match the COBE results, models with Omega = 1 and with more large-scale power than the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model predict lower streaming motions than are observed, but agree well with the dynamics of clustering on smaller scales. Unbiased Omega = 1 CDM models fit the COBE data and the streaming motions, but are less easily reconciled with galaxy clustering data on either small or large scales. Spatially flat CDM models with Omega of about 0.2 and a cosmological constant require the mass to be substantially more clustered than the galaxies in order to be consistent with COBE and with observed streaming motions. They are then in conflict, however, with dynamical measurements on smaller scales.},

abstract = {Here we present the results of various approaches to measure accurate colours and photometric redshifts (photo-z) from wide-field imaging data. We use data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey which have been re-processed by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) team in order to carry out a number of weak gravitational lensing studies. An emphasis is put on the correction of systematic effects in the photo-z arising from the different point spread functions (PSFs) in the five optical bands. Different ways of correcting these effects are discussed and the resulting photo-z accuracies are quantified by comparing the photo-z to large spectroscopic redshift (spec-z) data sets. Careful homogenization of the PSF between bands leads to increased overall accuracy of photo-z. The gain is particularly pronounced at fainter magnitudes where galaxies are smaller and flux measurements are affected more by PSF effects. We discuss ways of defining more secure subsamples of galaxies as well as a shape- and colour-based star-galaxy separation method, and we present redshift distributions for different magnitude limits. We also study possible re-calibrations of the photometric zero-points (ZPs) with the help of galaxies with known spec-z. We find that if PSF effects are properly taken into account, a re-calibration of the ZPs becomes much less important suggesting that previous such re-calibrations described in the literature could in fact be mostly corrections for PSF effects rather than corrections for real inaccuracies in the ZPs. The implications of this finding for future surveys like the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS), Dark Energy Survey (DES), Large Synoptic Survey Telescope or Euclid are mixed. On the one hand, ZP re-calibrations with spec-z values might not be as accurate as previously thought. On the other hand, careful PSF homogenization might provide a way out and yield accurate, homogeneous photometry without the need for full spectroscopic coverage. This is the first paper in a series describing the technical aspects of CFHTLenS.},

title = {Mapping cluster mass distributions via gravitational lensing of background galaxies},
abstract = {We present a new method for measuring the projected mass distributions of galaxy clusters, based solely on the gravitational lens amplification of background galaxies by the cluster potential field. The gravitational amplification is measured by comparing the joint distribution in redshift and magnitude of galaxies behind the cluster with that of the average distribution of field galaxies. Lensing shifts the magnitude distribution in a characteristic redshift-dependent way, and simultaneously dilutes the surface density of galaxies. These effects oppose, with the latter dominating at low redshift and the former at high redshift, owing to the curvature of the galaxy luminosity function. Lensing by a foreground cluster thus induces an excess of bright high-redshift galaxies, from which the lens amplification may be inferred. We show that the total amplification is directly related to the surface mass density in the weak field limit, and so it is possible to map the mass distribution of the cluster. The method is shown to be limited by discreteness noise and galaxy clustering behind the lens. Galaxy clustering sets a lower limit to the error along the redshift direction, but a clustering independent lensing signature may be obtained from the magnitude distribution at fixed redshift. Provided the luminosity function deviates from a pure power law, the lens-induced brightnening can be measured directly by comparison with the field. In the limit that galaxy luminosities are independent of environment, this method is only shot-noise limited. Statistical techniques are developed for estimating the surface mass density of the cluster. We extend these methods to account for any obscuration by cluster halo dust, which may be mappd independently of the dark matter. We apply the method to a series of numerical simulations and show the feasibility of the approach. We consider the use of approximate redshift information, and show how the mass estimates are degraded; finally we discuss the data required to map the dark matter in clusters from photometry alone.},

We detect correlated mass density from multiple halos and large-scale structure at radii larger than the virial radius and find the first observational evidence for growth in the galaxy-mass correlation on 10 Mpc scales with decreasing redshift and fixed range of luminosity. For a fixed range of redshift, we find a scaling of projected halo mass with rest-frame luminosity similar to previous studies at lower redshift. We control systematic errors in shape measurement and photometric redshift, enforce volume completeness through absolute magnitude cuts, and explore residual sample selection effects via simulations.},

We present results from a suite of cosmological N-body simulations aimed at investigating possible systematic errors in the recovery of cosmological distances. We show the robustness of baryonic peaks against nonlinearity, redshift distortions, and mild biases within the linear and quasi-linear regime at various redshifts. While mildly biased tracers follow the matter power spectrum well, redshift distortions do partially obscure baryonic features in redshift space compared to real space. We calculate the statistical constraints on cosmological distortions from N-body results and compare these to the analytic results from a Fisher matrix formalism. We conclude that the angular diameter distance will be constrained as well as in our previous Fisher matrix calculations while the Hubble parameter will be less constrained because of nonlinear redshift distortions.},

An initially adiabatic constant curvature perturbation spectrum is assumed. In models with cold dark matter, the simplest hypothesis - that galaxies follow the mass distribution leads to small-scale anisotropies which exceed current observational limits if omega is less than 0.2 h to the -4/3. Since low values of omega are indicated by dynamical studies of galaxy clustering, cold particle models in which light traces mass are probably incorrect. Reheating of the pregalactic medium is unlikely to modify this conclusion. In cold particle or neutrino-dominated universes with omega = 1, presented predictions for small-scale and quadrupole anisotropies are below current limits. In all cases, the small-scale fluctuations are predicted to be about 10 percent linearly polarized.},

title = {Combining spectroscopic and photometric surveys using angular cross-correlations II: Parameter constraints from different physical effects},
abstract = {Future spectroscopic and photometric surveys will measure accurate positions and shapes of an increasing number of galaxies. In the previous paper of this series we studied the effects of Redshift Space Distortions (RSD), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) using angular cross-correlation. Here, we provide a new forecast that explores the contribution of including different observables, physical effects (galaxy bias, WL, RSD, BAO) and approximations (non-linearities, Limber approximation, covariance between probes). The radial information is included by using the cross-correlation of separate narrow redshift bins. For the auto correlation the separation of galaxy pairs is mostly transverse, while the cross-correlations also includes a radial component. We study how this information adds to our figure of merit (FoM), which includes the dark energy equation of state {\$}w(z){\$} and the growth history, parameterized by {\$}\gamma{\$}. We show that the Limber approximation and galaxy bias are the most critical ingredients to the modelling of correlations. Adding WL increases our FoM by 4.8, RSD by 2.1 and BAO by 1.3. We also explore how overlapping surveys perform under the different assumption and for different figures of merit. Our qualitative conclusions depend on the survey choices and scales included, but we find some clear tendencies that highlight the importance of combining different probes and can be used to guide and optimise survey strategies.},

abstract = {Direct evidence for the existence of dark matter and measurements of its interaction cross-section have been provided by the physical offset between dark matter and intracluster gas in merging systems like the Bullet Cluster. Although a smaller signal, this effect is more abundant in minor mergers where infalling substructure dark matter and gas are segregated. In such low-mass systems the gravitational lensing signal comes primarily from weak lensing. A fundamental step in determining such an offset in substructure is the ability to accurately measure the positions of dark matter subpeaks. Using simulated Hubble Space Telescope observations, we make a first assessment of the precision and accuracy with which we can measure infalling groups using weak gravitational lensing. We demonstrate that using an existing and well-used mass reconstruction algorithm can measure the positions of 1.5 × 1013 M⊙ substructures that have parent haloes 10 times more massive with a bias of less than 0.3 arcsec. In this regime, our analysis suggests the precision is sufficient to detect (at 3σ statistical significance) the expected mean offset between dark matter and baryonic gas in infalling groups from a sample of ˜50 massive clusters.},

We present preliminary results of the implementation of this model in the prediction of the values of the concentration parameter for different masses and redshifts.},

title = {A theoretical framework for combining techniques that probe the link between galaxies and dark matter},
abstract = {We develop a theoretical framework that combines measurements of galaxy-galaxy lensing, galaxy clustering, and the galaxy stellar mass function in a self-consistent manner. While considerable effort has been invested in exploring each of these probes individually, attempts to combine them are still in their infancy despite the potential of such combinations to elucidate the galaxy-dark matter connection, to constrain cosmological parameters, and to test the nature of gravity. In this paper, we focus on a theoretical model that describes the galaxy-dark matter connection based on standard halo occupation distribution techniques. Several key modifications enable us to extract additional parameters that determine the stellar-to-halo mass relation and to simultaneously fit data from multiple probes while allowing for independent binning schemes for each probe. In a companion paper, we demonstrate that the model presented here provides an excellent fit to galaxy-galaxy lensing, galaxy clustering, and stellar mass functions measured in the COSMOS survey from z=0.2 to z=1.0. We construct mock catalogs from numerical simulations to investigate the effects of sample variance and covariance on each of the three probes. Finally, we analyze and discuss how trends in each of the three observables impact the derived parameters of the model. In particular, we investigate the various features of the observed galaxy stellar mass function (low-mass slope, plateau, knee, and high-mass cut-off) and show how each feature is related to the underlying relationship between stellar and halo mass. We demonstrate that the observed plateau feature in the stellar mass function at Mstellar~2x10^10 Msun is due to the transition that occurs in the stellar-to-halo mass relation at Mhalo ~ 10^12 Msun from a low-mass power-law regime to a sub-exponential function at higher stellar mass.},

title = {3D weak lensing},
abstract = {I propose an analysis method, based on spin-spherical harmonics and spherical Bessel functions, for large-scale weak lensing surveys which have source-distance information through photometric redshifts. I show that the distance information can significantly reduce statistical errors on cosmological parameters; in particular, 3D lensing analysis offers excellent prospects for constraining the equation of state of the vacuum energy which dominates the energy density of the Universe. I show that the ratio of pressure to energy density could be determined to an accuracy of ~1 per cent or better. Having distance information also offers significant advantages in the control of systematic effects such as the intrinsic alignment of galaxies. The case for obtaining photometric redshifts is therefore compelling. A signal-to-noise eigenmode analysis of the modes shows that the modes with highest signal-to-noise ratio correspond quite closely to ignoring the redshift information, but there is significant extra information from a few radial modes. These modes are generally long-wavelength, suggesting that useful information can be gleaned even if the photometric redshifts are relatively inaccurate.},

title = {Combining size and shape in weak lensing},
abstract = {Weak lensing alters the size of images with a similar magnitude to the distortion due to shear. Galaxy size probes the convergence field and shapes the shear field, both of which contain cosmological information. We show the gains expected in the dark energy figure of merit if galaxy size information is used in combination with galaxy shape. In any normal analysis of cosmic shear, galaxy sizes are also studied, so this is extra statistical information that comes for free and is currently unused. There are two main results in this Letter: first, we show that size measurement can be made uncorrelated with ellipticity measurement, thus allowing the full statistical gain from the combination, provided that sqrt{area} is used as a size indicator; secondly, as a proof of concept, we show that when the relevant modes are noise dominated, as is the norm for lensing surveys, the gains are substantial, with improvements of about 68 per cent in the figure of merit expected when systematic errors are ignored. An approximate treatment of such systematics such as intrinsic alignments and size-magnitude correlations, respectively, suggests that a much better improvement in the dark energy figure of merit of even a factor of ˜4 may be achieved.},

title = {Magnification effects as measures of large-scale structure},
abstract = {The magnification effects of clustered matter produce variations in the image sizes and number density of galaxies across the sky. This paper advocates the use of these effects in wide field surveys to map large-scale structure and the profiles of galaxy and cluster sized halos. The magnitude of the size variation as a function of angular scale is computed and the signal-to-noise is estimated for different survey parameters. Forthcoming surveys, especially well designed space-based imaging surveys, will have high signal-to-noise on scales of about 0.1 arcminute to several degrees. Thus the clustering of matter could be measured on spatial scales of about 50 Kpc to 100 Mpc. The signal-to-noise is dominated by sample variance rather than shot-noise due to the finite number density of galaxies, hence the accuracy of the measurements will be limited primarily by survey area, sampling strategy and possible systematics. Methods based on magnification are compared with the use of shape distortions and the contrasts and complementarities are discussed. Future work needed to plan survey strategy and interpret measurements based on magnification is outlined.},

title = {ROSAT PSPC observations of 36 high-luminosity clusters of galaxies: constraints on the gas fraction},
abstract = {We present a detailed and homogeneous analysis of the ROSAT PSPC surface brightness profiles of 36 clusters of galaxies with high X-ray luminosity (L_X >= 10^45 erg s^-1) and redshifts between 0.05 and 0.44. Using recent ASCA estimates of the temperature of the gas for most of the clusters in the sample, we apply both the deprojection technique and model fitting to the surface brightness profiles to constrain the gas and dark matter distributions under the assumption that the gas is both isothermal and hydrostatic. Applying robust estimators, we find that the gas fraction within r_500 of the clusters in our sample has a distribution centred on f_gas(r_500)=0.168 h_50^-1.5. The gas fraction ranges from 0.101 to 0.245 at the 95 per cent confidence level. The values of f_gas show highly significant variations between individual clusters, which may be explained if the dark matter has a significant baryonic component. Within a cluster, the average radial dependence of the gas mass fraction increases outward as r^s, with s~0.20. Combining these results with those of primordial nucleosynthesis calculations and the current estimate of H_0, the above central location implies Omega_0,m0.56 at the 95 per cent confidence level. This upper limit decreases to 0.34 if we take the highest significant estimates for f_gas. A significant decrease in cluster gas fraction with redshift from the local value, f_gas,0, of 0.21, found assuming Omega_0,m=1, is also reduced if Omega_0,m is low.},

This map shows individual features that are significant at the ~4σ level, providing the first image of CMB lensing convergence. We cross-correlate this map with Herschel/SPIRE maps covering 90 deg2 at wavelengths of 500, 350, and 250 μm. We show that these submillimeter (submm) wavelength maps are strongly correlated with the lensing convergence map, with detection significances in each of the three submm bands ranging from 6.7σ to 8.8σ. We fit the measurement of the cross power spectrum assuming a simple constant bias model and infer bias factors of b = 1.3-1.8, with a statistical uncertainty of 15%, depending on the assumed model for the redshift distribution of the dusty galaxies that are contributing to the Herschel/SPIRE maps.},

We measure the change in detected galaxy counts as well as the increased average galaxy flux behind the lenses. In addition, we measure the average change in source color due to extinction by dust in the lenses. By simultaneously fitting these three probes we constrain the mass profiles and dust-to-mass ratios of the lenses in six bins of lens richness. For each richness bin we fit an NFW halo mass, brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) mass, second halo term, and dust-to-mass ratio, and marginalize over our uncertainties in the lensing sensitivities alpha_{c,m}. We measure a mass-richness relation consistent with previous measurements of the catalogs, and limits on the dust-to-mass ratio in the lenses in agreement with expectations. We explore the effects of including the (low signal-to-noise) flux magnification and reddening measurements in the analysis compared to using only the counts magnification data; the additional probes significantly improve the agreement between our measured mass-richness relation and previous results.},

Unbiased Omega = 1 CDM models fit the COBE data and the streaming motions, but are less easily reconciled with galaxy clustering data on either small or large scales. Spatially flat CDM models with Omega of about 0.2 and a cosmological constant require the mass to be substantially more clustered than the galaxies in order to be consistent with COBE and with observed streaming motions. They are then in conflict, however, with dynamical measurements on smaller scales.},

title = {Cosmology with the largest galaxy cluster surveys: Going beyond Fisher matrix forecasts},
abstract = {We make the first detailed MCMC likelihood study of cosmological constraints that are expected from some of the largest, ongoing and proposed, cluster surveys in different wave-bands and compare the estimates to the prevalent Fisher matrix forecasts. Mock catalogs of cluster counts expected from the surveys - eROSITA, WFXT, RCS2, DES and Planck, along with a mock dataset of follow-up mass calibrations are analyzed for this purpose. A fair agreement between MCMC and Fisher results is found only in the case of minimal models. However, for many cases, the marginalized constraints obtained from Fisher and MCMC methods can differ by factors of 30-100%. The discrepancy can be alarmingly large for a time dependent dark energy equation of state, {\$}w(a){\$}; the Fisher methods are seen to under-estimate the constraints by as much as a factor of 4-5. Typically, Fisher estimates become more and more inappropriate as we move away from {\$}\Lambda{\$}CDM, to a constant-{\$}w{\$} dark energy to varying-{\$}w{\$} dark energy cosmologies. Fisher analysis, also, predicts incorrect parameter degeneracies. From the point of mass-calibration uncertainties, a high value of unknown scatter about the mean mass-observable relation, and its redshift dependence, is seen to have large degeneracies with the cosmological parameters {\$}\sigma_8{\$} and {\$}w(a){\$} and can degrade the cosmological constraints considerably. We find that the addition of mass-calibrated cluster datasets can improve dark energy and {\$}\sigma_8{\$} constraints by factors of 2-3 from what can be obtained compared to CMB+SNe+BAO only. Since, details of future cluster surveys are still being planned, we emphasize that optimal survey design must be done using MCMC analysis rather than Fisher forecasting. (abridged)},

title = {Gravitational lens magnification by Abell 1689: distortion of the background galaxy luminosity function},
abstract = {Gravitational lensing magnifies the observed flux of galaxies behind the lens. We use this effect to constrain the total mass in the cluster Abell 1689 by comparing the lensed luminosities of background galaxies with the luminosity function of an undistorted field. Under the assumption that these galaxies are a random sample of luminosity space, this method is not limited by clustering noise. We use photometric redshift information to estimate galaxy distance and intrinsic luminosity. Knowing the redshift distribution of the background population allows us to lift the mass/background degeneracy common to lensing analysis. In this paper we use nine filters observed over 12h with the Calar Alto 3.5-m telescope to determine the redshifts of 1000 galaxies in the field of Abell 1689. Using a complete sample of 146 background galaxies we measure the cluster mass profile. We find that the total projected mass interior to 0.25h-1Mpc is M2D(<0.25h-1Mpc)=(0.48+/- 0.16)×1015h-1Msolar, where our error budget includes uncertainties from the photometric redshift determination, the uncertainty in the offset calibration and finite sampling. This result is in good agreement with that found by number-count and shear-based methods and provides a new and independent method to determine cluster masses.},

title = {Mass-sheet degeneracy, power-law models and external convergence: Impact on the determination of the Hubble constant from gravitational lensing},
abstract = {The light travel time differences in strong gravitational lensing systems allows an independent determination of the Hubble constant. This method has been successfully applied to several lens systems. The formally most precise measurements are, however, in tension with the recent determination of H_0 from the Planck satellite for a spatially flat six-parameters {\$}\Lambda CDM{\$} cosmology. We reconsider the uncertainties of the method, concerning the mass profile of the lens galaxies, and show that the formal precision relies on the assumption that the mass profile is a global power law. Simple analytical and numerical experiments reveal that mass-sheet like transformations yield significant freedom in choosing the mass profile, even when exquisite Einstein rings are observed. Furthermore, the characterization of the environment of the lens will not break that degeneracy which is not physically linked to extrinsic convergence. We present an illustrative example where the multiple imaging properties of a composite (baryons + dark matter) lens can be extremely well reproduced by a power-law model, but with predictions for the Hubble constant that deviate by about 20\%. Hence we conclude that the impact of degeneracies between parametrized models might have been underestimated in current H_0 measurements from lensing, and need to be carefully reconsidered.},

title = {Image analysis for cosmology: results from the GREAT10 Galaxy Challenge},
abstract = {In this paper, we present results from the weak-lensing shape measurement GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing 2010 (GREAT10) Galaxy Challenge. This marks an order of magnitude step change in the level of scrutiny employed in weak-lensing shape measurement analysis. We provide descriptions of each method tested and include 10 evaluation metrics over 24 simulation branches. GREAT10 was the first shape measurement challenge to include variable fields; both the shear field and the point spread function (PSF) vary across the images in a realistic manner. The variable fields enable a variety of metrics that are inaccessible to constant shear simulations, including a direct measure of the impact of shape measurement inaccuracies, and the impact of PSF size and ellipticity, on the shear power spectrum. To assess the impact of shape measurement bias for cosmic shear, we present a general pseudo-Cℓ formalism that propagates spatially varying systematics in cosmic shear through to power spectrum estimates. We also show how one-point estimators of bias can be extracted from variable shear simulations. The GREAT10 Galaxy Challenge received 95 submissions and saw a factor of 3 improvement in the accuracy achieved by other shape measurement methods. The best methods achieve sub-per cent average biases. We find a strong dependence on accuracy as a function of signal-to-noise ratio, and indications of a weak dependence on galaxy type and size. Some requirements for the most ambitious cosmic shear experiments are met above a signal-to-noise ratio of 20. These results have the caveat that the simulated PSF was a ground-based PSF. Our results are a snapshot of the accuracy of current shape measurement methods and are a benchmark upon which improvement can be brought. This provides a foundation for a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of shape measurement methods.},

title = {The effects of galaxy formation on the matter power spectrum: A challenge for precision cosmology},
abstract = {Upcoming weak lensing surveys, such as LSST, EUCLID, and WFIRST, aim to measure the matter power spectrum with unprecedented accuracy. In order to fully exploit these observations, models are needed that, given a set of cosmological parameters, can predict the non-linear matter power spectrum at the level of 1% or better for scales corresponding to comoving wave numbers 0.1<k<10 h/Mpc. We have employed the large suite of simulations from the OWLS project to investigate the effects of various baryonic processes on the matter power spectrum. In addition, we have examined the distribution of power over different mass components, the back-reaction of the baryons on the CDM, and the evolution of the dominant effects on the matter power spectrum. We find that single baryonic processes are capable of changing the power spectrum by up to several tens of per cent. Our simulation that includes AGN feedback, which we consider to be our most realistic simulation as, unlike those used in previous studies, it has been shown to solve the overcooling problem and to reproduce optical and X-ray observations of groups of galaxies, predicts a decrease in power relative to a dark matter only simulation ranging, at z=0, from 1% at k~0.3 h/Mpc to 10% at k~1 h/Mpc and to 30% at k~10 h/Mpc. This contradicts the naive view that baryons raise the power through cooling, which is the dominant effect only for k>70 h/Mpc. Therefore, baryons, and particularly AGN feedback, cannot be ignored in theoretical power spectra for k>0.3 h/Mpc. It will thus be necessary to improve our understanding of feedback processes in galaxy formation, or at least to constrain them through auxiliary observations, before we can fulfil the goals of upcoming weak lensing surveys.},

title = {A filament of dark matter between two clusters of galaxies},
abstract = {It is a firm prediction of the concordance Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological model that galaxy clusters live at the intersection of large-scale structure filaments. The thread-like structure of this "cosmic web" has been traced by galaxy redshift surveys for decades. More recently the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) residing in low redshift filaments has been observed in emission and absorption. However, a reliable direct detection of the underlying Dark Matter skeleton, which should contain more than half of all matter, remained elusive, as earlier candidates for such detections were either falsified or suffered from low signal-to-noise ratios and unphysical misalignements of dark and luminous matter. Here we report the detection of a dark matter filament connecting the two main components of the Abell 222/223 supercluster system from its weak gravitational lensing signal, both in a non-parametric mass reconstruction and in parametric model fits. This filament is coincident with an overdensity of galaxies and diffuse, soft X-ray emission and contributes mass comparable to that of an additional galaxy cluster to the total mass of the supercluster. Combined with X-ray observations, we place an upper limit of 0.09 on the hot gas fraction, the mass of X-ray emitting gas divided by the total mass, in the filament.},

title = {Cosmological information in Gaussianized weak lensing signals},
abstract = {Gaussianizing the one-point distribution of the weak gravitational lensing convergence has recently been shown to increase the signal-to-noise ratio contained in two-point statistics. We investigate the information on cosmology that can be extracted from the transformed convergence fields. Employing Box-Cox transformations to determine optimal transformations to Gaussianity, we develop analytical models for the transformed power spectrum, including effects of noise and smoothing. We find that optimized Box-Cox transformations perform substantially better than an offset logarithmic transformation in Gaussianizing the convergence, but both yield very similar results for the signal-to-noise ratio. None of the transformations is capable of eliminating correlations of the power spectra between different angular frequencies, which we demonstrate to have a significant impact on the errors in cosmology. Analytic models of the Gaussianized power spectrum yield good fits to the simulations and produce unbiased parameter estimates in the majority of cases, where the exceptions can be traced back to the limitations in modelling the higher order correlations of the original convergence. In the ideal case, without galaxy shape noise, we find an increase in the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 2.6 for angular frequencies up to ℓ= 1500, and a decrease in the area of the confidence region in the Ωm-σ8 plane, measured in terms of q-values, by a factor of 4.4 for the best performing transformation. When adding a realistic level of shape noise, all transformations perform poorly with little decorrelation of angular frequencies, a maximum increase in signal-to-noise ratio of 34 per cent, and even slightly degraded errors on cosmological parameters. We argue that to find Gaussianizing transformations of practical use, it will be necessary to go beyond transformations of the one-point distribution of the convergence, extend the analysis deeper into the non-linear regime and resort to an exploration of parameter space via simulations.},

title = {A 3% Solution: Determination of the Hubble Constant with the Hubble Space Telescope and Wide Field Camera 3},
abstract = {We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to determine the Hubble constant from optical and infrared observations of over 600 Cepheid variables in the host galaxies of eight recent Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), providing the calibration for a magnitude-redshift relation based on 253 SNe Ia. Increased precision over past measurements of the Hubble constant comes from five improvements: (1) more than doubling the number of infrared observations of Cepheids in the nearby SN hosts; (2) increasing the sample size of ideal SN Ia calibrators from six to eight; (3) increasing by 20% the number of Cepheids with infrared observations in the megamaser host NGC 4258 (4) reducing the difference in the mean metallicity of the Cepheid comparison samples between NGC 4258 and the SN hosts from Δlog [O/H] = 0.08 to 0.05; and (5) calibrating all optical Cepheid colors with a single camera, WFC3, to remove cross-instrument zero-point errors. The result is a reduction in the uncertainty in H 0 due to steps beyond the first rung of the distance ladder from 3.5% to 2.3%. The measurement of H 0 via the geometric distance to NGC 4258 is 74.8 $\pm$ 3.1 km s-1 Mpc-1, a 4.1% measurement including systematic uncertainties. Better precision independent of the distance to NGC 4258 comes from the use of two alternative Cepheid absolute calibrations: (1) 13 Milky Way Cepheids with trigonometric parallaxes measured with HST/fine guidance sensor and Hipparcos and (2) 92 Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud for which multiple accurate and precise eclipsing binary distances are available, yielding 74.4 $\pm$ 2.5 km s-1 Mpc-1, a 3.4% uncertainty including systematics. Our best estimate uses all three calibrations but a larger uncertainty afforded from any two: H 0 = 73.8 $\pm$ 2.4 km s-1 Mpc-1 including systematic errors, corresponding to a 3.3% uncertainty. The improved measurement of H 0, when combined with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 7 year data, results in a tighter constraint on the equation-of-state parameter of dark energy of w = -1.08 $\pm$ 0.10. It also rules out the best-fitting gigaparsec-scale void models, posited as an alternative to dark energy. The combined H 0 + WMAP results yield N eff = 4.2 $\pm$ 0.7 for the number of relativistic particle species in the early universe, a low-significance excess for the value expected from the three known neutrino flavors.

title = {Cross-correlation of spectroscopic and photometric galaxy surveys: cosmology from lensing and redshift distortions},
abstract = {Cosmological galaxy surveys aim at mapping the largest volumes to test models with techniques such as cluster abundance, cosmic shear correlations or baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), which are designed to be independent of galaxy bias. Here, we explore an alternative route to constrain cosmology: sampling more moderate volumes with the cross-correlation of photometric and spectroscopic surveys. We consider the angular galaxy-galaxy auto-correlation in narrow redshift bins and its combination with different probes of weak gravitational lensing (WL) and redshift space distortions (RSD). Including the cross-correlation of these surveys improves by factors of a few the constraints on both the dark energy equation of state w(z) and the cosmic growth history, parametrized by γ. The additional information comes from using many narrow redshift bins and from measurement of galaxy bias with both WL and RSD, breaking degeneracies that are present when using each method separately. We show forecasts for a joint w(z) and γ figure of merit (FoM?) using linear scales over a deep (iAB < 24) photometric survey and a brighter (iAB < 22.5) spectroscopic or very accurate (0.3 per cent) photometric redshift survey. Magnification or shear in the photometric sample produce FoM? that are of the same order of magnitude of those of RSD or BAO over the spectroscopic sample. However, the cross-correlation of these probes over the same area yields a FoM? that is up to a factor of 100 times larger. Magnification alone, without shape measurements, can also be used for these cross-correlations and can produce better results than using shear alone. For a spectroscopic follow-up survey strategy, measuring the spectra of the foreground lenses to perform this cross-correlation provides five times better FoM? than targeting the higher redshift tail of the galaxy distribution to study BAO over a 2.5 times larger volume.},

We first show that the low-order clustering statistics of the dark-matter distribution depend almost entirely on the locations and density profiles of dark-matter haloes. The quasi-linear mass correlations are in fact reproduced well by a model of independent randomly-placed haloes. The distribution of galaxies within the halo density field depends on: (i) the efficiency of galaxy formation, as manifested by the halo occupation number - the number of galaxies brighter than some sample limit contained in a halo of a given mass; (ii) the location of these galaxies within their halo. The first factor is constrained by the empirical luminosity function of groups. For the second factor, we assume that one galaxy marks the halo centre, with any remaining galaxies acting as satellites that trace the halo mass. This second assumption is essential if small-scale galaxy correlations are to remain close to a single power law, rather than flattening in the same way as the correlations of the overall density field. These simple assumptions amount to a recipe for non-local bias, in which the probability of finding a galaxy is not a simple function of its local mass density. We have applied this prescription to some CDM models of current interest, and find that the predictions are close to the observed galaxy correlations for a flat Ω=0.3 model (ΛCDM), but not for an Ω=1 model with the same power spectrum (τCDM). This is an inevitable consequence of cluster normalization for the power spectra: cluster-scale haloes of given mass have smaller core radii for high Ω, and hence display enhanced small-scale clustering. Finally, the pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies in the ΛCDM model is lower than that of the mass, allowing cluster-normalized models to yield a realistic Mach number for the peculiar velocity field. This is largely due to the strong variation of galaxy-formation efficiency with halo mass that is required in this model.},

abstract = {Using data drawn from the DEEP2 and DEEP3 Galaxy Redshift Surveys, we investigate the relationship between the environment and the structure of galaxies residing on the red sequence at intermediate redshift. Within the massive (10 < log10(M★/h-2 M⊙) < 11) early-type population at 0.4 < z < 1.2, we find a significant correlation between local galaxy overdensity (or environment) and galaxy size, such that early-type systems in higher density regions tend to have larger effective radii (by ˜0.5 h-1 kpc or 25 per cent larger) than their counterparts of equal stellar mass and S{\'e}rsic index in lower density environments. This observed size-density relation is consistent with a model of galaxy formation in which the evolution of early-type systems at z < 2 is accelerated in high-density environments such as groups and clusters and in which dry, minor mergers (versus mechanisms such as quasar feedback) play a central role in the structural evolution of the massive, early-type galaxy population.},

CFHTLenS is based on the Wide component of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). It encompasses 154 deg^2 of deep, optical, high-quality, sub-arcsecond imaging data in the five optical filters u^*g'r'i'z'. The article presents our data processing of the complete CFHTLenS data set. We were able to obtain a data set with very good image quality and high-quality astrometric and photometric calibration. Our external astrometric accuracy is between 60-70 mas with respect to SDSS data and the internal alignment in all filters is around 30 mas. Our average photometric calibration shows a dispersion on the order of 0.01 to 0.03 mag for g'r'i'z' and about 0.04 mag for u^* with respect to SDSS sources down to i <= 21. In the spirit of the CFHTLS all our data products are released to the astronomical community via the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre.

title = {Lensing degeneracies and mass substructure},
abstract = {The inversion of gravitational lens systems is hindered by the fact that multiple mass distributions are often equally compatible with the observed properties of the images. Besides using clear examples to illustrate the effect of the so-called monopole and mass sheet degeneracies, this article introduces the most general form of said mass sheet degeneracy. While the well known version of this degeneracy rescales a single source plane, this generalization allows any number of sources to be rescaled. Furthermore, it shows how it is possible to rescale each of those sources with a different scale factor. Apart from illustrating that the mass sheet degeneracy is not broken by the presence of multiple sources at different redshifts, it will become apparent that the newly constructed mass distribution necessarily alters the existing mass density precisely at the locations of the images in the lens system, and that this change in mass density is linked to the factors with which the sources were rescaled. Combined with the fact that the monopole degeneracy introduces a large amount of uncertainty about the density in between the images, this means that both degeneracies are in fact closely related to substructure in the mass distribution. An example simulated lensing situation based on an elliptical version of a Navarro-Frenk-White profile explicitly shows that such degeneracies are not easily broken by observational constraints, even when multiple sources are present. Instead, the fact that each lens inversion method makes certain assumptions, implicit or explicit, about the smoothness of the mass distribution means that in practice the degeneracies are broken in an artificial manner rather than by observed properties of the lens system.},

title = {Steps towards nonlinear cluster inversion through gravitational distortions II. Generalization of the Kaiser and Squires method.},
abstract = {The weak distortions of high-redshift galaxies caused by gravitational light deflection near clusters of galaxies can be used to reconstruct the projected (two-dimensional) surface mass density of intermediate redshift clusters. This technique, pioneered by Tyson et al., and Kaiser {\&} Squires, is reconsidered in the present paper, where we generalize the inversion equation found by Kaiser {\&} Squires (KS) in several respect. Adopting a different smoothing procedure for the discreetly sampled data (individual galaxy images), we effectively reduce the shot noise in the KS procedure. In particular we show that the best density reconstructions are obtained if the smoothing scale is adapted to the `strength of the signal', which yields a better resolution near the center of the cluster where the distortions are strongest. Furthermore, we point out the importance of boundary effects and demonstrate their disastrous impact on rectangular data fields (CCDs) with large side ratio. Most important, however, is the generalization of the KS method to critical clusters, i.e., to such clusters which are capable of producing multiple images and giant luminous arcs. The corresponding modifications of the inversion procedure are severe; in particular, the resulting inversion equation is much more difficult to solve. As we pointed out in a previous paper (Schneider {\&} Seitz), there exists a local degeneracy if the cluster is critical. We have developed an iteration procedure to solve the inversion equation, which we demonstrate to yield a very accurate reconstruction of the cluster mass distribution. In particular, the mass within the inner few arcminutes of the cluster can be determined with an error of only a few percent, thus demonstrating the potential applicability and accuracy of this method for cluster mass determinations.},

title = {Cosmological parameter constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering with the SDSS DR7},
abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the cross-correlation coefficient between galaxies and dark matter is very close to unity on scales outside a few virial radii of galaxy haloes, independent of the details of how galaxies populate dark matter haloes. This finding makes it possible to determine the dark matter clustering from measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy clustering. We present new cosmological parameter constraints based on large-scale measurements of spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 7. We generalize the approach of Baldauf et al. to remove small-scale information (below 2 and 4 h-1 Mpc for lensing and clustering measurements, respectively), where the cross-correlation coefficient differs from unity. We derive constraints for three galaxy samples covering 7131 deg2, containing 69 150, 62 150 and 35 088 galaxies with mean redshifts of 0.11, 0.28 and 0.40. We clearly detect scale-dependent galaxy bias for the more luminous galaxy samples, at a level consistent with theoretical expectations. When we vary both σ8 and Ωm (and marginalize over non-linear galaxy bias) in a flat Λ cold dark matter model, the best-constrained quantity is σ8(Ωm/0.25)0.57 = 0.80 $\pm$ 0.05 (1σ, stat. + sys.), where statistical and systematic errors (photometric redshift and shear calibration) have comparable contributions, and we have fixed ns = 0.96 and h = 0.7. These strong constraints on the matter clustering suggest that this method is competitive with cosmic shear in current data, while having very complementary and in some ways less serious systematics. We therefore expect that this method will play a prominent role in future weak lensing surveys. When we combine these data with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7-year (WMAP7) cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, constraints on σ8, Ωm, H0, wde and {\Sigma}mν become 30-80 per cent tighter than with CMB data alone, since our data break several parameter degeneracies.},

Detected using the 3D-Matched-Filter cluster-finder of Milkeraitis et al., these cluster candidates span a wide range of masses, from the small group scale up to {\$}\sim10^{15} M_{{\o}dot}{\$}, and redshifts 0.2 {\$}\lesssim z\lesssim{\$} 0.9.

This first direct mass comparison yields important insights for improving the systematics handling of future lensing magnification work. In addition, we confirm analyses that suggest cluster miscentring has an important effect on the observed 3D-Matched-Filter halo profiles, and we quantify this by fitting for projected cluster centroid offsets, which are typically {\$}\sim{\$} 0.4 arcmin. We bin the cluster candidates as a function of redshift, finding similar cluster masses and richness across the full range up to {\$}z \sim{\$} 0.9. We measure the 3D-MF mass-richness scaling relation {\$}M_{200 } = M_0 (N_{200} / 20)^\beta{\$}. We find a normalization {\$}M_0 \sim (2.7^{+0.5}_{-0.4}) \times 10^{13} M_{{\o}dot}{\$}, and a logarithmic slope of {\$}\beta \sim 1.4 \pm 0.1{\$}, both of which are in 1{\$}\sigma{\$} agreement with results from the magnification analysis. We find no evidence for a redshift-dependence of the normalization. The CFHTLenS 3D-Matched-Filter cluster catalogue is now available at cfhtlens.org.},

title = {Precision cluster mass determination from weak lensing},
abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing has been used extensively in the past decade to constrain the masses of galaxy clusters, and is the most promising observational technique for providing the mass calibration necessary for precision cosmology with clusters. There are several challenges in estimating cluster masses, particularly (a) the sensitivity to astrophysical effects and observational systematics that modify the signal relative to the theoretical expectations, and (b) biases that can arise due to assumptions in the mass estimation method, such as the assumed radial profile of the cluster. All of these challenges are more problematic in the inner regions of the cluster, suggesting that their influence would ideally be suppressed for the purpose of mass estimation. However, at any given radius the differential surface density measured by lensing is sensitive to all mass within that radius, and the corrupted signal from the inner parts is spread out to all scales. We develop a new statistic Υ(RR0) that is ideal for estimation of cluster masses because it completely eliminates mass contributions below a chosen scale (which we suggest should be about 20 per cent of the virial radius), and thus reduces sensitivity to systematic and astrophysical effects. We use simulated and analytical profiles including shape noise to quantify systematic biases on the estimated masses for several standard methods of mass estimation, finding that these can lead to significant mass biases that range from 10 to over 50 per cent. The mass uncertainties when using the new statistic Υ(RR0) are reduced by up to a factor of 10 relative to the standard methods, while only moderately increasing the statistical errors. This new method of mass estimation will enable a higher level of precision in future science work with weak lensing mass estimates for galaxy clusters.},

title = {Testing gravity using the growth of large scale structure in the Universe},
abstract = {Future galaxy surveys hope to distinguish between the dark energy and modified gravity scenarios for the accelerating expansion of the Universe using the distortion of clustering in redshift space. The aim is to model the form and size of the distortion in order to infer the rate at which large scale structure grows. We test this hypothesis and assess the performance of current theoretical models for the redshift space distortion using very large volume N-body simulations of the gravitational instability process. We simulate competing cosmological models which have identical expansion histories - one is a quintessence dark energy model with a scalar field and the other is a modified gravity model with a time varying gravitational constant - and demonstrate that they do indeed produce different redshift space distortions. This is the first time this approach has been verified using a technique that can follow the growth of structure at the required level of accuracy. Our comparisons show that theoretical models for the redshift space distortion based on linear perturbation theory, which are currently in widespread use, give a surprisingly poor description of the simulation results. Furthermore, the application of such models can give rise to catastrophic systematic errors leading to an incorrect interpretation of the observations. We show that an improved model is able to extract the correct growth rate. Further enhancements to theoretical models of redshift space distortions, calibrated against simulations, are needed if we are to fully exploit the forthcoming high precision clustering measurements.},

title = {Measuring the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation scale using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey},
abstract = {We introduce a method to constrain general cosmological models using Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) distance measurements from galaxy samples covering different redshift ranges, and apply this method to analyse samples drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). BAOs are detected in the clustering of the combined 2dFGRS and SDSS main galaxy samples, and measure the distance-redshift relation at z = 0.2. BAOs in the clustering of the SDSS luminous red galaxies measure the distance-redshift relation at z = 0.35. The observed scales of the BAOs calculated from these samples and from the combined sample are jointly analysed using estimates of the correlated errors, to constrain the form of the distance measure DV(z) ≡ [(1 + z)2D2Acz/H(z)]1/3. Here DA is the angular diameter distance, and H(z) is the Hubble parameter. This gives rs/DV(0.2) = 0.1980 +/- 0.0058 and rs/DV(0.35) = 0.1094 +/- 0.0033 (1σ errors), with a correlation coefficient of 0.39, where rs is the comoving sound horizon scale at recombination. Matching the BAOs to have the same measured scale at all redshifts then gives DV(0.35)/DV(0.2) = 1.812 +/- 0.060. The recovered ratio is roughly consistent with that predicted by the higher redshift Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) supernova data for Λ cold dark matter cosmologies, but does require slightly stronger cosmological acceleration at a low redshift. If we force the cosmological model to be flat with constant w, then we find Ωm = 0.249 +/- 0.018 and w = -1.004 +/- 0.089 after combining with the SNLS data, and including the WMAP measurement of the apparent acoustic horizon angle in the cosmic microwave background.},

title = {Gravitational lensing in the supernova legacy survey (SNLS)},
abstract = { Aims: The observed brightness of type Ia supernovae is affected by gravitational lensing caused by the mass distribution along the line of sight, which introduces an additional dispersion into the Hubble diagram. We look for evidence of lensing in the SuperNova Legacy Survey 3-year data set. Methods: We investigate the correlation between the residuals from the Hubble diagram and the gravitational magnification based on a modeling of the mass distribution of foreground galaxies. A deep photometric catalog, photometric redshifts, and well established mass luminosity relations are used. Results: We find evidence of a lensing signal with a 2.3σ significance. The current result is limited by the number of SNe, their redshift distribution, and the other sources of scatter in the Hubble diagram. Separating the galaxy population into a red and a blue sample has a positive impact on the significance of the signal detection. On the other hand, increasing the depth of the galaxy catalog, the precision of photometric redshifts or reducing the scatter in the mass luminosity relations have little effect. We show that for the full SuperNova Legacy Survey sample (~400 spectroscopically confirmed type Ia SNe and ~200 photometrically identified type Ia SNe), there is an 80% probability of detecting the lensing signal with a 3σ significance.

title = {Re-capturing cosmic information},
abstract = {Gravitational lensing of distant galaxies can be exploited to infer the convergence field as a function of angular position on the sky. The statistics of this field, much like that of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), can be studied to extract information about fundamental parameters in cosmology, most notably the dark energy in the Universe. Unlike the CMB, the distribution of matter in the Universe which determines the convergence field is highly non-Gaussian, reflecting the nonlinear processes which accompanied structure formation. Much of the cosmic information contained in the initial field is therefore unavailable to the standard power spectrum measurements. Here we propose a method for re-capturing cosmic information by using the power spectrum of a simple function of the observed (nonlinear) convergence field. We adapt the approach of Neyrinck et al. (2009) to lensing by using a modified logarithmic transform of the convergence field. The Fourier transform of the log-transformed field has modes that are nearly uncorrelated, which allows for additional cosmological information to be extracted from small-scale modes.},

title = {Recovering 3D clustering information with angular correlations},
abstract = {We study how to recover the full 3D clustering information ofP(k, z), including redshift space distortions (RSD), from 2D tomography using the angular auto- and cross-spectra of different redshift bins Cℓ(z, z'). We focus on quasi-linear scales where the minimum scale λmin or corresponding maximum wavenumber k max =2π/λ min is targeted to be in the range k max ={0.05-0.2} h Mpc -1. For spectroscopic surveys, we find that we can recover the full 3D clustering information when the redshift bin width Δz used in the 2D tomography is similar to the targeted minimum scale, i.e. Δz≃{0.6-0.8} λ min H(z)/c which corresponds to Δz≃0.01-0.05 for z < 1. This value of Δz is optimal in the sense that larger values of Δz lose information, while smaller values violate our minimum-scale requirement. For a narrow-band photometric survey, with photo-z error σz = 0.004, we find almost identical results to the spectroscopic survey because the photo-z error is smaller than the optimal bin width σz < Δz. For a typical broad-band photometric survey with σz = 0.1, we have that σz > Δz and most radial information is intrinsically lost. The remaining information can be recovered from the 2D tomography if we use Δz ≃ 2σz. While 3D and 2D analyses are shown here to be equivalent, the advantage of using angular positions and redshifts is that we do not need a fiducial cosmology to convert to 3D coordinates. This avoids assumptions and marginalization over the fiducial model. In addition, it becomes straightforward to combine RSD, clustering and weak lensing in 2D space.},

title = {Magnification Effects on Source Counts and Fluxes},
abstract = { We consider the effect of lensing magnification on high redshift sources in the case that magnification varies on the sky, as expected in wide fields of view or within observed galaxy clusters. We give expressions for number counts, flux and flux variance as integrals over the probability distribution of the magnification. We obtain these through a simple mapping between averages over the observed sky and over the magnification probability distribution in the source plane. Our results clarify conflicting expressions in the literature and can be used to calculate a variety of magnification effects. We highlight two applications: 1. Lensing of high-z galaxies by galaxy clusters can provide the dominant source of scatter in SZ observations at frequencies larger than the SZ null. 2. The number counts of high-z galaxies with a Schechter-like luminosity function will be changed at high luminosities to a power law, with significant enhancement of the observed counts at L > 10 L*. },

These use the Data Release 9 (DR9) CMASS sample, which contains 264 283 massive galaxies covering 3275 square degrees with an effective redshift z = 0.57 and redshift range 0.43 < z < 0.7. Assuming a concordance ΛCDM cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2 Gpc3, and represents the largest sample of the Universe ever surveyed at this density, n¯≈3×10-4 h-3 Mpc 3. We measure the angle-averaged galaxy correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of 5σ in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Combining with the SDSS-II luminous red galaxy sample, the detection significance increases to 6.7σ. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance to z = 0.57 relative to the sound horizon DV/rs = 13.67 $\pm$ 0.22 at z = 0.57. Assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19 Mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds to a distance DV (z = 0.57) = 2094 $\pm$ 34 Mpc. At 1.7 per cent, this is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. We place this result alongside previous BAO measurements in a cosmological distance ladder and find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. We use these distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, finding continuing support for a flat Universe with a cosmological constant.},

This new sample extends the flux limit of the original REFLEX catalogue to 1.8 × 10-12 erg s-1 cm-2, yielding a total of 911 clusters with ≥94 per cent completeness in redshift follow-up. The analysis of the data is improved by creating a set of 100 REFLEX II-catalogue-like mock galaxy cluster catalogues built from a suite of large-volume Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) N-body simulations (L-BASICC II). The measured power spectrum is in agreement with the predictions from a ΛCDM cosmological model. The measurements show the expected increase in the amplitude of the power spectrum with increasing X-ray luminosity. On large scales, we show that the shape of the measured power spectrum is compatible with a scale-independent bias and provide a model for the amplitude that allows us to connect our measurements with a cosmological model. By implementing a luminosity-dependent power-spectrum estimator, we observe that the power spectrum measured from the REFLEX II sample is weakly affected by flux-selection effects. The shape of the measured power spectrum is compatible with a featureless power spectrum on scales k > 0.01 h Mpc-1 and hence no statistically significant signal of baryonic acoustic oscillations can be detected. We show that the measured REFLEX II power spectrum displays signatures of non-linear evolution.},

Our analysis hence indicates that this model provides a self-consistent description of the growth of cosmic structure through large-scale perturbations and the homogeneous cosmic expansion mapped by supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations. We achieve robust results by systematically comparing our data with several different models of the quasi-linear growth of structure including empirical models, fitting formulae calibrated to N-body simulations, and perturbation theory techniques. We extract the first measurements of the power spectrum of the velocity divergence field, P_vv(k), as a function of redshift (under the assumption that P_gv(k) = -sqrt[P_gg(k) P_vv(k)] where g is the galaxy overdensity field), and demonstrate that the WiggleZ galaxy-mass cross-correlation is consistent with a deterministic (rather than stochastic) scale-independent bias model for WiggleZ galaxies for scales k < 0.3 h/Mpc. Measurements of the cosmic growth rate from the WiggleZ Survey and other current and future observations offer a powerful test of the physical nature of dark energy that is complementary to distance-redshift measures such as supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations.},

title = {Cosmic shear analysis of archival HST/ACS data. I. Comparison of early ACS pure parallel data to the HST/GEMS survey},
abstract = {Context: This is the first paper of a series describing our measurement of weak lensing by large-scale structure, also termed ``cosmic shear'', using archival observations from the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Aims: In this work we present results from a pilot study testing the capabilities of the ACS for cosmic shear measurements with early parallel observations and presenting a re-analysis of HST/ACS data from the GEMS survey and the GOODS observations of the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS). Methods: We describe the data reduction and, in particular, a new correction scheme for the time-dependent ACS point-spread-function (PSF) based on observations of stellar fields. This is currently the only technique which takes the full time variation of the PSF between individual ACS exposures into account. We estimate that our PSF correction scheme reduces the systematic contribution to the shear correlation functions due to PSF distortions to <2 × 10-6 for galaxy fields containing at least 10 stars, which corresponds to ⪉5% of the cosmological signal expected on scales of a single ACS field. Results: We perform a number of diagnostic tests indicating that the remaining level of systematics is consistent with zero for the GEMS and GOODS data confirming the success of our PSF correction scheme. For the parallel data we detect a low level of remaining systematics which we interpret to be caused by a lack of sufficient dithering of the data. Combining the shear estimate of the GEMS and GOODS observations using 96 galaxies arcmin-2 with the photometric redshift catalogue of the GOODS-MUSIC sample, we determine a local single field estimate for the mass power spectrum normalisation σ8, CDFS=0.52+0.11-0.15 (stat) $\pm$ 0.07(sys) (68% confidence assuming Gaussian cosmic variance) at a fixed matter density Ω_m=0.3 for a ΛCDM cosmology marginalising over the uncertainty of the Hubble parameter and the redshift distribution. We interpret this exceptionally low estimate to be due to a local under-density of the foreground structures in the CDFS.

title = {Analytic model for galaxy and dark matter clustering},
abstract = {We investigate an analytic model to compute the non-linear power spectrum of dark matter, galaxies and their cross-correlation. The model is based on Press-Schechter haloes, which cluster and have realistic dark matter profiles. The total power spectrum is a sum of two contributions, one from correlations between the haloes and one from correlations within the same halo. We show that such a model can give dark matter power spectra which match well with the results of N-body simulations, provided that the concentration parameter decreases with the halo mass. The galaxy power spectrum differs from the dark matter power spectrum because the pair-weighted number of galaxies does not scale with the halo mass and because most haloes harbour a central galaxy. If the pair-weighted number of galaxies increases less rapidly than the halo mass, as predicted by theoretical models and observed in clusters, then the resulting power spectrum becomes a power law with a slope close to the observed over several orders of magnitude in scale. Such a model also predicts a later onset of non-linear clustering in comparison with dark matter, which is needed to reconcile the cold dark matter (CDM) models with the data. A generic prediction of this model is that bias is scale-dependent and non-monotonic. This is particularly important for red or elliptical galaxies, which are preferentially found in larger mass haloes and for which the bias in the power spectrum may be scale-dependent even on large scales. Our predictions for galaxy-dark matter correlations, which can be observed through galaxy-galaxy lensing, show that these cannot be interpreted simply as an average halo profile of a typical galaxy, because different halo masses dominate at different scales and because larger haloes host more than one galaxy. We compute predictions for the cross-correlation coefficient as a function of scale and discuss the prospects of using cross-correlations in combination with galaxy clustering to determine the dark matter power spectrum.},

title = {The 6dF Galaxy Survey: baryon acoustic oscillations and the local Hubble constant},
abstract = {We analyse the large-scale correlation function of the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) and detect a baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal at 105 h-1 Mpc. The 6dFGS BAO detection allows us to constrain the distance-redshift relation at zeff= 0.106. We achieve a distance measure of DV(zeff) = 457 $\pm$ 27 Mpc and a measurement of the distance ratio, rs(zd)/DV(zeff) = 0.336 $\pm$ 0.015 (4.5 per cent precision), where rs(zd) is the sound horizon at the drag epoch zd. The low-effective redshift of 6dFGS makes it a competitive and independent alternative to Cepheids and low-z supernovae in constraining the Hubble constant. We find a Hubble constant of H0= 67 $\pm$ 3.2 km s-1 Mpc-1 (4.8 per cent precision) that depends only on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe-7 (WMAP-7) calibration of the sound horizon and on the galaxy clustering in 6dFGS. Compared to earlier BAO studies at higher redshift, our analysis is less dependent on other cosmological parameters. The sensitivity to H0 can be used to break the degeneracy between the dark energy equation of state parameter w and H0 in the cosmic microwave background data. We determine that w=-0.97 $\pm$ 0.13, using only WMAP-7 and BAO data from both 6dFGS and Percival et al. (2010). We also discuss predictions for the large-scale correlation function of two future wide-angle surveys: the Wide field ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) blind H I survey (with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, ASKAP) and the proposed Transforming Astronomical Imaging surveys through Polychromatic Analysis of Nebulae (TAIPAN) all-southern-sky optical galaxy survey with the UK Schmidt Telescope. We find that both surveys are very likely to yield detections of the BAO peak, making WALLABY the first radio galaxy survey to do so. We also predict that TAIPAN has the potential to constrain the Hubble constant with 3 per cent precision.},

title = {Cosmological information in Gaussianised weak lensing signals},
abstract = {We investigate the information on cosmology contained in Gaussianised weak gravitational lensing convergence fields. Employing Box-Cox transformations to determine optimal transformations to Gaussianity, we develop analytical models for the transformed power spectrum, including effects of noise and smoothing. We find that optimised Box-Cox transformations perform substantially better than an offset logarithmic transformation in Gaussianising the convergence, but both yield very similar results for the signal-to-noise and parameter constraints. None of the transformations is capable of eliminating correlations of the power spectra between different angular frequencies, which we demonstrate to have a significant impact on the errors on cosmology. Analytic models of the Gaussianised power spectrum yield good fits to the simulations and produce unbiased parameter estimates in the majority of cases, where the exceptions can be traced back to the limitations in modelling the higher-order correlations of the original convergence. In the idealistic case, without galaxy shape noise, we find an increase in cumulative signal-to-noise by a factor of 2.6 for angular frequencies up to 1500, and a decrease in the area of the confidence region in the Omega_m-sigma_8 plane by a factor of 4.4 in terms of q-values for the best-performing transformation. When adding a realistic level of shape noise, all transformations perform poorly with little decorrelation of angular frequencies, a maximum increase in signal-to-noise of 34%, and even marginally degraded errors on cosmological parameters. We argue that, to find Gaussianising transformations of practical use, one will need to go beyond transformations of the one-point distribution of the convergence, extend the analysis deeper into the non-linear regime, and resort to an exploration of parameter space via simulations.

title = {New constraints on dark energy from the observed growth of the most X-ray luminous galaxy clusters},
abstract = {We present constraints on the mean matter density, Ωm, the normalization of the density fluctuation power spectrum, σ8, and the dark energy equation of state parameter, w, obtained from measurements of the X-ray luminosity function of the largest known galaxy clusters at redshifts z < 0.7, as compiled in the Massive Cluster Survey (MACS) and the local Brightest Cluster Sample (BCS) and ROSAT-ESO Flux Limited X-Ray (REFLEX) galaxy cluster sample. Our analysis employs an observed mass-luminosity relation, calibrated by hydrodynamical simulations, including corrections for non-thermal pressure support and accounting for the presence of intrinsic scatter. Conservative allowances for all known systematic uncertainties are included, as are standard priors on the Hubble constant and mean baryon density. We find Ωm = 0.28+0.11-0.07 and σ8 = 0.78+0.11-0.13 for a spatially flat, cosmological constant model, and Ωm = 0.24+0.15-0.07,σ8 = 0.85+0.13-0.20 and w = -1.4+0.4-0.7 for a flat, constant w model (marginalized 68 per cent confidence intervals). Our findings constitute the first determination of the dark energy equation of state from measurements of the growth of cosmic structure in galaxy clusters, and the consistency of our result with w = -1 lends additional support to the cosmological constant model. Future work improving our understanding of redshift evolution and observational biases affecting the mass-X-ray luminosity relation have the potential to significantly tighten these constraints. Our results are consistent with those from recent analyses of Type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background anisotropies, the X-ray gas mass fraction of relaxed galaxy clusters, baryon acoustic oscillations and cosmic shear. Combining the new X-ray luminosity function data with current supernova, cosmic microwave background and cluster gas fraction data yields the improved constraints Ωm = 0.269 +/- 0.016,σ8 = 0.82 +/- 0.03 and w = -1.02 +/- 0.06.},

title = {A Cosmic Coincidence: The Power-Law Galaxy Correlation Function},
abstract = {We model the evolution of galaxy clustering through cosmic time to investigate the nature of the power-law shape of xi(r), the galaxy two-point correlation function. Departures from a power law are mainly governed by galaxy pair counts on small scales, subject to non-linear dynamics. We assume that galaxies reside within dark matter halos and subhalos and use a semi-analytic substructure evolution model to study subhalo populations within host halos. We find that tidal mass loss and, to a lesser degree, dynamical friction deplete the number of subhalos within larger host halos over time by ~90%, just the right amount for achieving a power-law xi(r) at z = 0. We find that xi(r) breaks from a power law at high masses, implying that only galaxies of luminosities <= Lstar should exhibit power-law clustering. We also demonstrate that xi(r) evolves from being far from a power law at high redshift, toward a near power law at z = 0 and deviates in the future. This is mainly caused by the evolving competition between the accretion and destruction rates of subhalos, which happen to strike just the right balance at z~0. We show that key ingredients determining the shape of xi(r) are the fraction of galaxies that are satellites, the relative difference in mass between the halos of isolated galaxies and galaxies that contain a single satellite on average, and the rareness of halos that host galaxies. These pieces are intertwined and we find no simple, universal rule for which a power-law xi(r) will occur. However, we do show that the physics responsible for setting the galaxy content of halos do not care about the conditions needed to achieve a power law xi(r) and these conditions are met only in a narrow mass and redshift range. We conclude that the power-law nature of xi(r) for Lstar and fainter galaxy samples at low redshift is a cosmic coincidence. (Abridged)},

title = {How robust are predictions of galaxy clustering?},
abstract = {We use the Millennium Simulation database to compare how different versions of the Durham and Munich semi-analytical galaxy formation models populate dark matter haloes with galaxies. The models follow the same physical processes but differ in how these are implemented. All of the models we consider use the Millennium N-body Simulation; however, the Durham and Munich groups use independent algorithms to construct halo merger histories. We compare the predicted halo occupation distributions (HODs) and correlation functions for galaxy samples defined by stellar mass, cold gas mass and star formation rate. The predictions for the HOD are remarkably similar for samples ranked by stellar mass. The predicted bias averaged over 5-25 Mpc/h is consistent between models to within 10%. At small pair separations there is a difference in the predicted clustering. This arises because the Durham models allow some satellite galaxies to merge with the central galaxy in a halo when they are still associated with resolved subhaloes. The agreement between the models is less good for samples defined by cold gas mass or star formation rate, with the small scale clustering differing by an order of magnitude, reflecting the uncertainty in the modelling of star formation. The model predictions in these cases are qualitatively similar, with a markedly shallower slope for the correlation function than is found for stellar mass selected samples and with the HOD displaying an asymmetric peak for central galaxies. We provide illustrative parametric fits to the HODs predicted by the models. Our results reveal the current limitations on how well we can predict galaxy bias in a fixed cosmology, which has implications for the interpretation of constraints on the physics of galaxy formation from galaxy clustering measurements and the ability of future galaxy surveys to measure dark energy.},

title = {Angular correlation function of 1.5 million luminous red galaxies: clustering evolution and a search for baryon acoustic oscillations},
abstract = {We present the angular correlation function measured from photometric samples comprising 1562 800 luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Three LRG samples were extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging data, based on colour-cut selections at redshifts, z≈ 0.35, 0.55 and 0.7 as calibrated by the spectroscopic surveys, SDSS-LRG, 2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO (quasi-stellar object) (2SLAQ) and the AAΩ-LRG survey. The galaxy samples cover ≈7600 deg2 of sky, probing a total cosmic volume of ≈5.5 h-3 Gpc3. The small- and intermediate-scale correlation functions generally show significant deviations from a single power-law fit with a well-detected break at ≈1 h-1 Mpc, consistent with the transition scale between the one- and two-halo terms in halo occupation models. For galaxy separations 1-20 h-1 Mpc and at fixed luminosity, we see virtually no evolution of the clustering with redshift and the data are consistent with a simple high peaks biasing model where the comoving LRG space density is constant with z. At fixed z, the LRG clustering amplitude increases with luminosity in accordance with the simple high peaks model, with a typical LRG dark matter halo mass 1013-1014 h-1 M⊙. For r < 1 h-1 Mpc, the evolution is slightly faster and the clustering decreases towards high redshift consistent with a virialized clustering model. However, assuming the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) halo merger frameworks, ˜2-3 per cent/Gyr of the LRGs are required to merge in order to explain the small scales clustering evolution, consistent with previous results. At large scales, our result shows good agreement with the SDSS-LRG result of Eisenstein et al. but we find an apparent excess clustering signal beyond the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) scale. Angular power spectrum analyses of similar LRG samples also detect a similar apparent large-scale clustering excess but more data are required to check for this feature in independent galaxy data sets. Certainly, if the ΛCDM model were correct then we would have to conclude that this excess was caused by systematics at the level of Δw≈ 0.001-0.0015 in the photometric AAΩ-LRG sample.},

title = {Weak lensing goes bananas: what flexion really measures},
abstract = {In weak gravitational lensing, the image distortion caused by shear measures the projected tidal gravitational field of the deflecting mass distribution. To lowest order, the shear is proportional to the mean image ellipticity. If the image sizes are not small compared to the scale over which the shear varies, higher-order distortions occur, called flexion. For ordinary weak lensing, the observable quantity is not the shear, but the reduced shear, owing to the mass-sheet degeneracy. Likewise, the flexion itself is unobservable. Instead, higher-order image distortions measure the reduced flexion, i.e., derivatives of the reduced shear. We derive the corresponding lens equation in terms of the reduced flexion and calculate the resulting relation between brightness moments of source and image. Assuming an isotropic distribution of source orientations, estimates for the reduced shear and flexion are obtained and then tested with simulations. In particular, the presence of flexion affects the determination of the reduced shear. The results of these simulations yield the amount of bias of the estimators as a function of the shear and flexion. We point out and quantify a fundamental limitation of the flexion formalism in terms of the product of reduced flexion and source size. If this product increases above the derived threshold, multiple images of the source are formed locally, and the formalism breaks down. Finally, we show how a general (reduced) flexion field can be decomposed into its four components. Two of them are due to a shear field, carrying an E- and B-mode in general. The other two components do not correspond to a shear field, and they can also be split up into corresponding E- and B-modes.},

abstract = {We use weak gravitational lensing to analyse the dark matter halos around satellite galaxies in galaxy groups in the CFHTLenS dataset. This dataset is derived from the CFHTLS-Wide survey, and encompasses 154 sq. deg of high-quality shape data. Using the photometric redshifts, we divide the sample of lens galaxies with stellar masses in the range 10^9 Msun to 10^10.5 Msun into those likely to lie in high-density environments (HDE) and those likely to lie in low-density environments (LDE). Through comparison with galaxy catalogues extracted from the Millennium Simulation, we show that the sample of HDE galaxies should primarily (~61%) consist of satellite galaxies in groups, while the sample of LDE galaxies should consist of mostly (~87%) non-satellite (field and central) galaxies. Comparing the lensing signals around samples of HDE and LDE galaxies matched in stellar mass, the lensing signal around HDE galaxies clearly shows a positive contribution from their host groups on their lensing signals at radii of ~500-1000 kpc, the typical separation between satellites and group centres. More importantly, the subhalos of HDE galaxies are less massive than those around LDE galaxies by a factor 0.65 +/- 0.12, significant at the 2.9 sigma level. A natural explanation is that the halos of satellite galaxies are stripped through tidal effects in the group environment. Our results are consistent with a typical tidal truncation radius of ~40 kpc.},

abstract = {To determine the magnification of an extended source caused by gravitational lensing one has to perform a two-dimensional integral over point-source magnifications in general. Since the point-source magnification jumps to an infinite value on caustics, special care is required. For a uniformly bright source, it has been shown earlier that the calculation simplifies if one determines the magnification from the area of the images of the extended source by applying Green's theorem so that one ends up with a one-dimensional integration over the image boundaries. This approach is discussed here in detail, and it is shown that it can be used to yield a robust and efficient method also for limb-darkened sources. It is also shown that the centroid shift can be calculated in a similar way.},

title = {Revealing the Properties of Dark Matter in the Merging Cluster MACS J0025.4-1222},
abstract = {We constrain the physical nature of dark matter using the newly identified massive merging galaxy cluster MACS J0025.4-1222. As was previously shown by the example of the Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56), such systems are ideal laboratories for detecting isolated dark matter and distinguishing between cold dark matter (CDM) and other scenarios (e.g., self-interacting dark matter, alternative gravity theories). MACS J0025.4-1222 consists of two merging subclusters of similar richness at z=0.586. We measure the distribution of X-ray-emitting gas from Chandra X-ray data and find it to be clearly displaced from the distribution of galaxies. A strong (information from highly distorted arcs) and weak (using weakly distorted background galaxies) gravitational lensing analysis based on Hubble Space Telescope observations and Keck arc spectroscopy confirms that the subclusters have near-equal mass. The total mass distribution in each of the subclusters is clearly offset (at >4 σ significance) from the peak of the hot X-ray-emitting gas (the main baryonic component) but aligned with the distribution of galaxies. We measure the fractions of mass in hot gas (0.09+0.07-0.03) and stars (0.010+0.007-0.004), consistent with those of typical clusters, finding that dark matter is the dominant contributor to the gravitational field. Under the assumption that the subclusters experienced a head-on collision in the plane of the sky, we obtain an order-of-magnitude estimate of the dark matter self-interaction cross section of σ/m<4 cm2 g-1, reaffirming the results from the Bullet Cluster on the collisionless nature of dark matter.

abstract = {We study cosmic variance in deep high-redshift surveys and its influence on the determination of the luminosity function for high-redshift galaxies. For several survey geometries relevant for Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) instruments, we characterize the distribution of the galaxy number counts. This is obtained by means of analytic estimates via the two-point correlation function in extended Press-Schechter theory, as well as by using synthetic catalogs extracted from N-body cosmological simulations of structure formation. We adopt a simple luminosity-dark halo mass relation to investigate the effects of environment on the fitting of the luminosity function. We show that in addition to variations of the normalization of the luminosity function, a steepening of its slope is also expected in underdense fields, similar to what is observed within voids in the local universe. Therefore, to avoid introducing artificial biases, caution must be taken when attempting to correct for field underdensity, such as in the case of the HST UDF i-dropout sample, which exhibits a deficit of bright counts with respect to the average counts in GOODS. A public version of the cosmic variance calculator based on the two-point correlation function integration is available on the Web at STScI.},

title = {The WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey: direct constraints on blue galaxy intrinsic alignments at intermediate redshifts},
abstract = {Correlations between the intrinsic shapes of galaxy pairs, and between the intrinsic shapes of galaxies and the large-scale density field, may be induced by tidal fields. These correlations, which have been detected at low redshifts (z < 0.35) for bright red galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and for which upper limits exist for blue galaxies at z˜ 0.1, provide a window into galaxy formation and evolution, and are also an important contaminant for current and future weak lensing surveys. Measurements of these alignments at intermediate redshifts (z˜ 0.6) that are more relevant for cosmic shear observations are very important for understanding the origin and redshift evolution of these alignments, and for minimizing their impact on weak lensing measurements. We present the first such intermediate-redshift measurement for blue galaxies, using galaxy shape measurements from SDSS and spectroscopic redshifts from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. Our null detection allows us to place upper limits on the contamination of weak lensing measurements by blue galaxy intrinsic alignments that, for the first time, do not require significant model-dependent extrapolation from the z˜ 0.1 SDSS observations. Also, combining the SDSS and WiggleZ constraints gives us a long redshift baseline with which to constrain intrinsic alignment models and contamination of the cosmic shear power spectrum. Assuming that the alignments can be explained by linear alignment with the smoothed local density field, we find that a measurement of σ8 in a blue-galaxy dominated, CFHTLS-like survey would be contaminated by at most +0.02-0.03 (95 per cent confidence level, SDSS and WiggleZ) or $\pm$ 0.03 (WiggleZ alone) due to intrinsic alignments. We also allow additional power-law redshift evolution of the intrinsic alignments, due to (for example) effects like interactions and mergers that are not included in the linear alignment model, and find that our constraints on cosmic shear contamination are not significantly weakened if the power-law index is less than ˜2. The WiggleZ sample (unlike SDSS) has a long enough redshift baseline that the data can rule out the possibility of very strong additional evolution.},

We present such a formalism, the parameterized post-Friedmann framework (PPF), which parameterizes the cosmological perturbation theory of a wide variety of modified gravity models. PPF is able to handle spin-0 degrees of freedom from new scalar, vector, and tensor fields, meaning that it is not restricted to simple models based solely on cosmological scalar fields. A direct correspondence is maintained between the parameterization and the underlying space of theories, which allows us to build up a ``dictionary'' of modified gravity theories and their PPF correspondences. In this paper we describe the construction of the parameterization and demonstrate its use through a number of worked examples relevant to the current literature. We indicate how the formalism will be implemented numerically, so that the dictionary of modified gravity can be pitted against forthcoming observations.},

title = {The removal of shear-ellipticity correlations from the cosmic shear signal via nulling techniques},
abstract = {Aims: To render cosmic shear an astronomical tool of high precision, it is essential to eliminate systematic effects upon its signal, one of the most significant ones being the intrinsic alignment of galaxies. The alignment in tidal fields that are created by the surrounding matter structure induces correlations between the intrinsic ellipticities of source galaxies, as well as correlations between the gravitational shear and the intrinsic ellipticity. While the former effect is restricted to physically close galaxy pairs and thus relatively easy to control, shear-ellipticity correlations occur for pairs at large separations. Because of the crudeness of current models of intrinsic alignment, we have developed a model-independent, purely geometrical method for removing the contamination of the cosmic shear signal by shear-ellipticity correlations. Methods: We remove the contributions to a tomographic cosmic shear signal that may be subject to contamination by shear-ellipticity correlations, making use of the characteristic dependence of these correlations on redshift. By introducing an appropriately chosen weight function to the lensing efficiency that nulls signals stemming from certain distances, new second-order measures of cosmic shear can be constructed that are free from intrinsic alignment. We present three approaches to determining such weight functions, optimized with respect to the amount of information the weighting preserves. After generalizing the construction of weight functions, the loss of information induced by this nulling technique and the subsequent degradation of constraints on cosmological parameters is quantified in a likelihood analysis. Results: For constructing optimal weight functions, good agreement is achieved between all approaches considered. In particular, a simplified analytical ansatz is shown to approximate the numerical results closely, significantly lowering computational efforts. For a survey divided into 20 redshift bins, we find that the area of credible regions increases by 20% up to about 50% after the application of nulling, depending on the cosmological parameters considered. We demonstrate that, due to the optimization of the weight functions, nearly all information is contained in a small subset of the new second-order measures. The use of a significantly smaller number of redshift bins than 20 for the nulling considerably degrades parameter constraints under conservative assumptions, emphasizing the need for detailed redshift information.},

title = {Measuring Redshift-Space Distortions using Photometric Surveys},
abstract = {We outline how redshift-space distortions (RSD) can be measured from the angular correlation function w({\theta}), of galaxies selected from photometric surveys. The natural degeneracy between RSD and galaxy bias can be minimized by comparing results from bins with top-hat galaxy selection in redshift, and bins based on the radial position of galaxy pair centres. This comparison can also be used to test the accuracy of the photometric redshifts. The presence of RSD will be clearly detectable with the next generation of photometric redshift surveys. We show that the Dark Energy Survey (DES) will be able to measure f(z){\sigma}_8(z) to a 1{\sigma} accuracy of (17 {\times} b)%, using galaxies drawn from a single narrow redshift slice centered at z = 1. Here b is the linear bias, and f is the logarithmic rate of change of the linear growth rate with respect to the scale factor. Extending to measurements of w({\theta}) for a series of bins of width 0.02(1 + z) over 0.5 < z < 1.4 will measure {\gamma} to a 1{\sigma} accuracy of 25%, given the model f = {{\O}mega}_m(z)^{\gamma}, and assuming a linear bias model that evolves such that b = 0.5 + z (and fixing other cosmological parameters). The accuracy of our analytic predictions is confirmed using mock catalogs drawn from simulations conducted by the MICE collaboration.},

abstract = {The first building block for using galaxy clusters in astrophysics and cosmology is an accurate determination of their mass, which can be estimated with weak lensing (WL) determinations or X-ray analyses assuming hydrostatic equilibrium (HE). By comparing the two mass proxies in well observed samples of rich clusters, we determined the intrinsic scatters, sigma_{WL}~15 per cent for WL masses and sigma_{HE}~25 per cent for HE masses. The certain assessment of the bias is hampered by differences as large as ~40 per cent in either WL or HE mass estimates reported by different groups. If the scatter in the mass proxy is not considered, the slope of any scaling relation `mass-observable' is biased towards shallower values, whereas the intrinsic scatter of the scaling is over-estimated.},

Studies with surveys that cover greater than a percent of the sky will require techniques that incorporate the curvature of the sky. We lay the groundwork for these studies by deriving the full sky minimum variance quadratic estimators of the lensing potential from the CMB temperature and polarization fields. We also present a general technique for constructing these estimators, with harmonic space convolutions replaced by real space products, that is appropriate for both the full sky limit and the flat sky approximation. This also extends previous treatments to include estimators involving the temperature-polarization cross-correlation and should be useful for next generation experiments in which most of the additional information from polarization comes from this channel due to sensitivity limitations.},

title = {Only marginal alignment of disc galaxies},
abstract = {Testing theories of angular-momentum acquisition of rotationally supported disc galaxies is the key to understand the formation of this type of galaxies. The tidal-torque theory tries to explain this acquisition process in a cosmological framework and predicts positive autocorrelations of angular-momentum orientation and spiral-arm handedness on distances of 1Mpc/h. This disc alignment can also cause systematic effects in weak-lensing measurements. Previous observations claimed discovering such correlations but did not account for errors in redshift, ellipticity and morphological classifications. We explain how to rigorously propagate all important errors. Analysing disc galaxies in the SDSS database, we find that positive autocorrelations of spiral-arm handedness and angular-momentum orientations on distances of 1Mpc/h are plausible but not statistically significant. This result agrees with a simple hypothesis test in the Local Group, where we find no evidence for disc alignment. Moreover, we demonstrate that ellipticity estimates based on second moments are strongly biased by galactic bulges, thereby corrupting correlation estimates and overestimating the impact of disc alignment on weak-lensing studies. Finally, we discuss the potential of future sky surveys. We argue that photometric redshifts have too large errors, i.e., PanSTARRS and LSST cannot be used. We also discuss potentials and problems of front-edge classifications of galaxy discs in order to improve estimates of angular-momentum orientation.},

abstract = {The spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) galaxy sample represents the final set of galaxies observed using the original SDSS target selection criteria. We analyse the clustering of galaxies within this sample, including both the luminous red galaxy and main samples, and also include the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey data. In total, this sample comprises 893319 galaxies over 9100deg2. Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are observed in power spectra measured for different slices in redshift; this allows us to constrain the distance-redshift relation at multiple epochs. We achieve a distance measure at redshift z = 0.275, of rs(zd)/DV(0.275) = 0.1390 +/- 0.0037 (2.7 per cent accuracy), where rs(zd) is the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch, DV(z) ≡ [(1 + z)2D2Acz/H(z)]1/3, DA(z) is the angular diameter distance and H(z) is the Hubble parameter. We find an almost independent constraint on the ratio of distances DV(0.35)/DV(0.2) = 1.736 +/- 0.065, which is consistent at the 1.1σ level with the best-fitting Λ cold dark matter model obtained when combining our z = 0.275 distance constraint with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 5-year (WMAP5) data. The offset is similar to that found in previous analyses of the SDSS DR5 sample, but the discrepancy is now of lower significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and a change in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. Using WMAP5 constraints on Ωbh2 and Ωch2, and combining our BAO distance measurements with those from the Union supernova sample, places a tight constraint on Ωm = 0.286 +/- 0.018 and H0 = 68.2 +/- 2.2kms-1Mpc-1 that is robust to allowing Ωk ≠ 0 and w ≠ -1. This result is independent of the behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed by the BAO and supernova measurements. Combining these data sets with the full WMAP5 likelihood constraints provides tight constraints on both Ωk = -0.006 +/- 0.008 and w = -0.97 +/- 0.10 for a constant dark energy equation of state.},

title = {Calibration errors unleashed: effects on cosmological parameters and requirements for large-scale structure surveys},
abstract = {Imperfect photometric calibration of galaxy surveys due to either astrophysical or instrumental effects leads to biases in measuring galaxy clustering and the resulting cosmological parameter measurements. More interestingly (and disturbingly), the spatially varying calibration also generically leads to violations of statistical isotropy of the galaxy clustering signal. Here we develop, for the first time, a formalism to propagate the effects of photometric calibration variations with arbitrary spatial dependence across the sky to the observed power spectra and to the cosmological parameter constraints. We develop an end-to-end pipeline to study the effects of calibration, and illustrate our results using specific examples including Galactic dust extinction and survey-dependent magnitude limits as a function of zenith angle of the telescope. We establish requirements on the control of calibration so that it doesn't significantly bias constraints on dark energy and primordial non-Gaussianity. Two principal findings are: 1) largest-angle photometric calibration variations (dipole, quadrupole and a few more modes, though not the monopole) are the most damaging, and 2) calibration will need to be understood at the 0.1%-1% level (i.e. rms variations mapped out to accuracy between 0.001 and 0.01 mag), though the precise requirement strongly depends on the faint-end slope of the luminosity function and the redshift distribution of galaxies in the survey.},

title = {Detection of large-scale intrinsic ellipticity-density correlation from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and implications for weak lensing surveys},
abstract = {The power spectrum of weak lensing shear caused by large-scale structure is an emerging tool for precision cosmology, in particular for measuring the effects of dark energy on the growth of structure at low redshift. One potential source of systematic error is intrinsic alignments of ellipticities of neighbouring galaxies [the intrinsic ellipticity-intrinsic ellipticity (II) correlation] that could mimic the correlations due to lensing. A related possibility pointed out by Hirata {\&} Seljak is correlation between the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and the density field responsible for gravitational lensing shear [the gravitational shear-intrinsic ellipticity (GI) correlation]. We present constraints on both the II and GI correlations using 265908 spectroscopic galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and using galaxies as tracers of the mass in the case of the GI analysis. The availability of redshifts in the SDSS allows us to select galaxies at small radial separations, which both reduces noise in the intrinsic alignment measurement and suppresses galaxy-galaxy lensing (which otherwise swamps the GI correlation). While we find no detection of the II correlation, our results are none the less statistically consistent with recent detections found using the SuperCOSMOS survey. Extrapolation of these limits to cosmic shear surveys at z~ 1 suggests that the II correlation is unlikely to have been a significant source of error for current measurements of σ8 with ~10 per cent accuracy, but may still be an issue for future surveys with projected statistical errors below the 1 per cent level unless eliminated using photometric redshifts. In contrast, we have a clear detection of GI correlation in galaxies brighter than L* that persists to the largest scales probed (60h-1 Mpc) and with a sign predicted by theoretical models. This correlation could cause the existing lensing surveys at z~ 1 to underestimate the linear amplitude of fluctuations by as much as 20 per cent depending on the source sample used, while for surveys at z~ 0.5 the underestimation may reach 30 per cent. The GI contamination is dominated by the brightest galaxies, possibly due to the alignment of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with the cluster ellipticity due to anisotropic infall along filaments, although other sources of contamination cannot be excluded at this point. We propose that cosmic shear surveys should consider rejection of BCGs from their source catalogues as a test for GI contamination. Future high-precision weak lensing surveys must develop methods to search for and remove this contamination if they are to achieve their promise.},

abstract = {A new X-ray-selected and X-ray flux-limited galaxy cluster sample is presented. Based on the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, the 63 brightest clusters with galactic latitude |bII|>=20$\,^{\circ}$ and flux fX(0.1-2.4keV)>=2×10-11ergss- 1cm-2 have been compiled. Gravitational masses have been determined utilizing intracluster gas density profiles, derived mainly from ROSAT PSPC pointed observations, and gas temperatures, as published mainly from ASCA observations, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. This sample and an extended sample of 106 galaxy clusters is used to establish the X-ray luminosity-gravitational mass relation. From the complete sample the galaxy cluster mass function is determined and used to constrain the mean cosmic matter density and the amplitude of mass fluctuations. Comparison to Press-Schechter type model mass functions in the framework of cold dark matter cosmological models and a Harrison-Zeldovich initial density fluctuation spectrum yields the constraints Ωm=0.12+0.06-0.04 and σ8=0.96+0.15-0.12 (90% c.l.). Various possible systematic uncertainties are quantified. Adding all identified systematic uncertainties to the statistical uncertainty in a worst-case fashion results in an upper limit Ωm<0.31. For comparison to previous results a relation σ8=0.43Ω-0.38m is derived. The mass function is integrated to show that the contribution of mass bound within virialized cluster regions to the total matter density is small; i.e., Ωcluster=0.012+0.003-0.004 for cluster masses larger than 6.4+0.7-0.6×1013h- 150Msolar.},

title = {CFHTLenS: The Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey - Imaging Data and Catalogue Products},
abstract = {We present data products from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). CFHTLenS is based on the Wide component of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). It encompasses 154 deg^2 of deep, optical, high-quality, sub-arcsecond imaging data in the five optical filters u^*g'r'i'z'. The article presents our data processing of the complete CFHTLenS data set. We were able to obtain a data set with very good image quality and high-quality astrometric and photometric calibration. Our external astrometric accuracy is between 60-70 mas with respect to SDSS data and the internal alignment in all filters is around 30 mas. Our average photometric calibration shows a dispersion on the order of 0.01 to 0.03 mag for g'r'i'z' and about 0.04 mag for u^* with respect to SDSS sources down to i <= 21. In the spirit of the CFHTLS all our data products are released to the astronomical community via the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre. We give a description and how-to manuals of the public products which include image pixel data, source catalogues with photometric redshift estimates and all relevant quantities to perform weak lensing studies.},

title = {Halo Shapes From Weak Lensing: The Impact of Galaxy-Halo Misalignment},
abstract = {We analyse the impact of galaxy-halo misalignment on the ability of weak lensing studies to constrain the shape of dark matter haloes, using a combination of the Millennium dark matter N-body simulation and different semi-analytic galaxy formation models, as well as simpler Monte Carlo tests. Since the distribution of galaxy-halo alignments is not known in detail, we test various alignment models, together with different methods of determining the halo shape. In addition to alignment, we examine the interplay of halo mass and shape, and galaxy colour and morphology with the resulting stacked projected halo shape. We find that only in the case where significant numbers of galaxy and halo minor axes are parallel does the stacked, projected halo axis ratio fall below 0.95. When using broader misalignment distributions, such as those found in recent simulations of galaxy formation, the halo ellipticity signal is washed out and would be extremely difficult to measure observationally. It is important to note that the spread in stacked halo axis ratio due to theoretical unknowns (differences between semi-analytic models, and between alignment models) are much bigger than any statistical uncertainty: It is naive to assume that, simply because {\Lambda}CDM predicts aspherical haloes, the stacked projected shape will be elliptical. In fact, there is no robust {\Lambda}CDM prediction yet for this procedure, and the interpretation of any such elliptical halo signal from lensing in terms of physical halo properties will be extremely difficult.},

title = {The Lens Parallax Method: Determining Redshifts of Faint Blue Galaxies through Gravitational Lensing},
abstract = {We propose a new technique, which we call the lens parallax method, to determine simultaneously the redshift distribution of the faint blue galaxies and the mass distributions of foreground clusters of galaxies. The method is based on gravitational lensing and makes use of the following: (1) the amplitude of lensing-induced distortions of background galaxies increases with redshift; (2) the surface brightnesses of galaxies decrease steeply with redshift The distortions of galaxy images due to lensing are thus expected to be inversely correlated with surface brightness, allowing us to obtain relative distances to galaxies as a function of surface brightness. If the redshifts of the brightest galaxies are measured, then the relative distance scale can be converted to mean galaxy redshifts as a function of surface brightness. Further, by comparing the angular sizes of lensed galaxies with those of similar galaxies in empty control fields, it is possible to break the so-called mass sheet degeneracy inherent to cluster mass reconstruction techniques that are based purely on image ellipticities. This allows an unambiguous determination of the surface density of a lensing cluster. We describe an iterative algorithm based on these ideas and present numerical simulations which show that the proposed techniques are feasible with a sample of ≍10 rich clusters at moderate redshifts ˜0.3-0.4 and an equal number of control fields. The numerical tests show that the method can be used to determine the redshifts of galaxies with an accuracy of Δz ≍ 0.1-0.2 at z ˜1-1.7, and to measure the masses of lensing clusters to about 5% accuracy.},

title = {Intrinsic alignment-lensing interference as a contaminant of cosmic shear},
abstract = {Cosmic shear surveys have great promise as tools for precision cosmology, but can be subject to systematic errors including intrinsic ellipticity correlations of the source galaxies. The intrinsic alignments are believed to be small for deep surveys, but this is based on intrinsic and lensing distortions being uncorrelated. Here we show that the gravitational lensing shear and intrinsic shear need not be independent: correlations between the tidal field and the intrinsic shear cause the intrinsic shear of nearby galaxies to be correlated with the gravitational shear acting on more distant galaxies. We estimate the magnitude of this effect for two simple intrinsic-alignment models: one in which the galaxy ellipticity is linearly related to the tidal field, and one in which it is quadratic in the tidal field as suggested by tidal torque theory. The first model predicts a gravitational-intrinsic (GI) correlation that can be much greater than the intrinsic-intrinsic (II) correlation for broad redshift distributions, and that remains when galaxies pairs at similar redshifts are rejected. The second model, in its simplest form, predicts no gravitational-intrinsic correlation. In the first model, and assuming a normalization consistent with recently claimed detections of intrinsic correlations, we find that the GI correlation term can exceed the usual II term by >1 order of magnitude and the intrinsic correlation induced B-mode by 2 orders of magnitude. These interference effects can suppress the lensing power spectrum for a single broad redshift bin by of order ˜10% at zs=1 and ˜30% at zs=0.5. We conclude that, depending on the intrinsic-alignment model, the GI correlation may be the dominant contaminant of the lensing signal and can even affect cross spectra between widely separated bins. We describe two ways to constrain this effect, one based on density-shear correlations and one based on scaling of the cross correlation tomography signal with redshift.},

abstract = {Webster and colleagues (1988) reported a significant excess of foreground galaxies in the vicinity of quasars. It is shown that if the effect is due to gravitational lensing, then the quasar-galaxy correlation must be smaller than the reported level by a factor of about 2 and/or the magnitude limit of the survey must be a few tenths of a magnitude brighter than the stated limit of B(J) = 18.7. Also, contrary to popular belief, the effect does not require that halos of foreground galaxies be composed of microlenses (stars, black holes, etc.); the quasar-galaxy correlation works equally well with smooth halos. These conclusions follow directly from the quasar luminosity function and are independent of the structure of the lens.},

title = {Wide-Field Lensing Mass Maps from DES Science Verification Data},
abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing allows one to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the projected mass density across the sky. These "mass maps" provide a powerful tool for studying cosmology as they probe both luminous and dark matter. In this paper, we present a weak lensing mass map reconstructed from shear measurements in a 139 deg^2 area from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification (SV) data overlapping with the South Pole Telescope survey. We compare the distribution of mass with that of the foreground distribution of galaxies and clusters. The overdensities in the reconstructed map correlate well with the distribution of optically detected clusters. Cross-correlating the mass map with the foreground galaxies from the same DES SV data gives results consistent with mock catalogs that include the primary sources of statistical uncertainties in the galaxy, lensing, and photo-z catalogs. The statistical significance of the cross-correlation is at the 6.8 sigma level with 20 arcminute smoothing. A major goal of this study is to investigate systematic effects arising from a variety of sources, including PSF and photo-z uncertainties. We make maps derived from twenty variables that may characterize systematics and find the principal components. We find that the contribution of systematics to the lensing mass maps is generally within measurement uncertainties. We test and validate our results with mock catalogs from N-body simulations. In this work, we analyze less than 3% of the final area that will be mapped by the DES; the tools and analysis techniques developed in this paper can be applied to forthcoming larger datasets from the survey.},

title = {Statistical properties of the convergence due to weak gravitational lensing by non-linear structures},
abstract = {Density fluctuations in the matter distribution lead to distortions of the images of distant galaxies through weak gravitational lensing effects. This provides an efficient probe of the cosmological parameters and of the density field. In this article, we investigate the statistical properties of the convergence due to weak gravitational lensing by non-linear structures (i.e. we consider small angular windows theta <~ 1'). Previous studies have shown how to relate the second and third order moments of the convergence to those of the density contrast while models based on the Press-Schechter prescription provide an estimate of the tail of P(kappa ). Here we present a method to obtain an estimate of the full p.d.f. of the convergence kappa. It is based on a realistic description of the density field which applies to overdense as well as underdense regions. We show that our predictions agree very well with the results of N-body simulations for the convergence. This could allow one to derive the cosmological parameters (Omega_m ,Omega_mega Lambda ) as well as the full p.d.f. P(delta_R ) of the density contrast itself in the non-linear regime from observations. Hence this gives a very powerful tool to constrain scenarios of structure formation.},

abstract = {We use a complete sample of about 140000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to study the size distribution of galaxies and its dependence on their luminosity, stellar mass and morphological type. The large SDSS data base provides statistics of unprecedented accuracy. For each type of galaxy, the size distribution at given luminosity (or stellar mass) is well described by a log-normal function, characterized by its median and dispersion σlnR. For late-type galaxies, there is a characteristic luminosity at Mr,0~-20.5 (assuming h= 0.7) corresponding to a stellar mass M0~ 1010.6 Msolar. Galaxies more massive than M0 have and σlnR~ 0.3, while less massive galaxies have and σlnR~ 0.5. For early-type galaxies, the relation is significantly steeper, , but the σlnR-M relation is similar to that of bright late-type galaxies. Faint red galaxies have sizes quite independent of their luminosities. We use simple theoretical models to interpret these results. The observed relation for late-type galaxies can be explained if the fraction of baryons that form stars is as predicted by the standard feedback model. Fitting the observed σlnR-M relation requires in addition that the bulge/disc mass ratio be larger in haloes of lower angular momentum and that the bulge material transfers part of its angular momentum to the disc. This can be achieved if bulge formation occurs so as to maintain a marginally stable disc. For early-type galaxies, the observed σlnR-M relation is inconsistent with formation through single major mergers of present-day discs. It is consistent with formation through repeated mergers, if the progenitors have properties similar to those of faint ellipticals or Lyman break galaxies and merge from relatively strongly bound orbits.},

It is shown that the shape of this correlation function depends sensitively on the spectrum of the density fluctuations in the Universe, thus providing a possibility to distinguish between different models for the spectrum. Using numerical large-scale structure simulations, I estimate that the QSO-galaxy correlation function can be measured from galaxy counts down to =~21^st^...22^nd^ magnitude in fields with radius <~25' around 50...100 QSOs with redshift z>=1. Since the QSO-galaxy correlation function is proportional to (-a-1)b, where b is the biasing factor of galaxy formation and a is the effective slope of the QSO number counts, steep number counts are favorable for this kind of analysis. I show that a=-4...-5 can be achieved with the 1-Jansky sample of radio-loud QSOs when the double-waveband magnification bias is employed. Moreover, the cross-correlation analysis allows to determine the galaxy-formation bias factor b.},

abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

abstract = {We simulated both the matter and light (galaxy) distributions in a wedge of the Universe and calculated the gravitational lensing magnification caused by the mass along the line-of-sight of galaxies and galaxy groups identified in sky surveys. A large volume redshift cone containing cold dark matter particles mimics the expected cosmological matter distribution in a flat universe with low matter density and a cosmological constant. We generate a mock galaxy catalogue from the matter distribution and identify thousands of galaxy groups in the luminous sky projection. We calculate the expected magnification around galaxies and galaxy groups and then the induced quasi-stellar object (QSO)-lens angular correlation due to magnification bias. This correlation is observable and can be used both to estimate the average mass of the lens population and to make cosmological inferences. We also use analytical calculations and various analyses to compare the observational results with theoretical expectations for the cross-correlation between faint QSOs from the 2dF Survey and nearby galaxies and groups from the Automated Plate Measurement and Sloan Digital Sky Survey Early Data Release. The observed QSO-lens anticorrelations are stronger than the predictions for the cosmological model used. This suggests that there could be unknown systematic errors in the observations and data reduction, or that the model used is not adequate. If the observed signal is assumed to be solely due to gravitational lensing, then the lensing is stronger than expected, due to more massive galactic structures or more efficient lensing than simulated.},

title = {Probing Galaxy Dark Matter Haloes in COSMOS with Weak Lensing Flexion},
abstract = {Current theories of structure formation predict specific density profiles of galaxy dark matter haloes, and with weak gravitational lensing we can probe these profiles on several scales. On small scales, higher-order shape distortions known as flexion add significant detail to the weak lensing measurements. We present here the first detection of a galaxy-galaxy flexion signal in space-based data, obtained using a new Shapelets pipeline introduced here. We combine this higher-order lensing signal with shear to constrain the average density profile of the galaxy lenses in the Hubble Space Telescope COSMOS survey. We also show that light from nearby bright objects can significantly affect flexion measurements. After correcting for the influence of lens light, we show that the inclusion of flexion provides tighter constraints on density profiles than does shear alone. Finally we find an average density profile consistent with an isothermal sphere.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present results from the weak-lensing shape measurement GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing 2010 (GREAT10) Galaxy Challenge. This marks an order of magnitude step change in the level of scrutiny employed in weak-lensing shape measurement analysis. We provide descriptions of each method tested and include 10 evaluation metrics over 24 simulation branches. GREAT10 was the first shape measurement challenge to include variable fields; both the shear field and the point spread function (PSF) vary across the images in a realistic manner. The variable fields enable a variety of metrics that are inaccessible to constant shear simulations, including a direct measure of the impact of shape measurement inaccuracies, and the impact of PSF size and ellipticity, on the shear power spectrum. To assess the impact of shape measurement bias for cosmic shear, we present a general pseudo-Cℓ formalism that propagates spatially varying systematics in cosmic shear through to power spectrum estimates. We also show how one-point estimators of bias can be extracted from variable shear simulations. The GREAT10 Galaxy Challenge received 95 submissions and saw a factor of 3 improvement in the accuracy achieved by other shape measurement methods. The best methods achieve sub-per cent average biases. We find a strong dependence on accuracy as a function of signal-to-noise ratio, and indications of a weak dependence on galaxy type and size. Some requirements for the most ambitious cosmic shear experiments are met above a signal-to-noise ratio of 20. These results have the caveat that the simulated PSF was a ground-based PSF. Our results are a snapshot of the accuracy of current shape measurement methods and are a benchmark upon which improvement can be brought. This provides a foundation for a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of shape measurement methods.},

title = {Weak Lensing: Prospects for Measuring Cosmological Parameters},
abstract = {Weak lensing of galaxies by large-scale structure can potentially measure cosmological quantities as accurately as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). However, the relation between observables and fundamental parameters is more complex and degenerate, especially in the full space of adiabatic cold dark matter models considered here. We introduce a Fisher matrix analysis of the information contained in weak-lensing surveys to address these issues and provide a simple means of estimating how survey properties and source redshift uncertainties affect parameter measurement. We find that surveys on degree scales and above can improve the accuracy on parameters that affect the growth rate of structure by up to an order of magnitude compared to using the CMB alone, even if the characteristic redshift of the sources must be determined from the data itself. Surprisingly, both sparse sampling and increasing the source redshift can weaken the cosmological constraints.},

title = {On the impact of intergalactic dust on cosmology with Type Ia supernovae},
abstract = {Supernova (SN) measurements have become a key ingredient in current determinations of cosmological parameters. These sources can however be used as standard candles only after correcting their apparent brightness for a number of effects. In this paper, we discuss some limitations imposed by the formalism currently used for such corrections and investigate the impact on cosmological constraints. We show that colour corrections are, in general, expected to be biased. In addition, colour excesses which do not add a significant scatter to the observed SN brightnesses affect the value of cosmological parameters but leave the slope of the colour-luminosity relation unchanged. We quantify these biases in the context of the redshift-dependent dust extinction suggested by the recent detection of intergalactic dust by M{\'e}nard et al. Using a range of models for the opacity of the Universe as a function of redshift, we find that colour-magnitude-stretch scaling relations are virtually insensitive to the presence of cosmic dust while cosmological parameters such as ΩM and w are biased at the level of a few per cent, i.e. offsets comparable to the current statistical errors. Future surveys will be able to limit the impact of intergalactic extinction by observing at longer wavelengths. In addition, such data sets will provide direct detections of intergalactic dust by cross-correlating SN colours and the density of foreground galaxies, which can be used as a consistency check on the cosmic dust extinction correction. Alternatively, such biases could be avoided by correcting the colours of SNe on an object-by-object basis with accurate photometry.},

abstract = {We use semi-analytic modelling of the galaxy-cluster population and its strong lensing efficiency to explore how the expected abundance of large gravitational arcs on the sky depends on σ_8. Our models take all effects into account that have been shown to affect strong cluster lensing substantially, in particular cluster asymmetry, substructure, merging, and variations in the central density concentrations. We show that the optical depth for long and thin arcs increases by approximately one order of magnitude when σ8 increases from 0.7 to 0.9, owing to a constructive combination of several effects. Models with high σ8 are also several orders of magnitude more efficient in producing arcs at intermediate and high redshifts. Finally, we use realistic source number counts to quantitatively predict the total number of arcs brighter than several magnitude limits in the R and I bands. We confirm that, while σ8 ~ 0.9 may come close to the known abundance of arcs, even σ8 ~ 0.8 falls short by almost an order of magnitude in reproducing known counts. We conclude that, should σ8 ~ 0.8 be confirmed, we would fail to understand the strong-lensing efficiency of the galaxy cluster population, and in particular the abundance of arcs in high-redshift clusters. We argue that early-dark energy or non-Gaussian density fluctuations may indicate one way out of this problem.},

title = {CARS: The CFHTLS-Archive-Research Survey. III. First detection of cosmic magnification in samples of normal high-z galaxies},
abstract = {Context: Weak gravitational lensing (WL) has been established as one of the most promising probes of cosmology. So far, most studies have exploited the shear effect of WL leading to coherent distortions of galaxy shapes. WL also introduces coherent magnifications. Aims: We want to detect this cosmic magnification effect (coherent magnification by the large-scale structure of the Universe) in large samples of high-redshift galaxies selected from the Deep part of the Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). Methods: Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) selected by their colours to be at z= 2.5-5, are used as a background sample and are cross-correlated to foreground lens galaxies, which are selected by accurate photometric redshifts (photo-z's). The signals of LBGs in different magnitude bins are compared to predictions from WL theory. An optimally weighted correlation function is estimated by taking into account the slope of external LBG luminosity functions. Results: For the first time, we detect cosmic magnification in a sample of normal galaxies. These background sources are also the ones with the highest redshifts so far used for WL measurements. The amplitude and angular dependence of the cross-correlation functions agree well with theoretical expectations and the lensing signal is detected with high significance. Avoiding low-redshift ranges in the foreground samples which might contaminate the LBG samples we can make a measurement that is virtually free of systematics. In particular, we detect an anti-correlation between faint LBGs and foreground galaxies which cannot be caused by redshift overlap. Conclusions: Cross-correlating LBGs (and in future also photo-z selected galaxies) as background sources to well understood foreground samples based on accurate photo-z's will become a powerful cosmological probe in future large imaging surveys. Based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii.

title = {The Integrated Polarization of Spiral Galaxy Disks},
abstract = {We present integrated polarization properties of nearby spiral galaxies at 4.8 GHz, and models for the integrated polarization of spiral galaxy disks as a function of inclination. Spiral galaxies in our sample have observed integrated fractional polarization in the range lsim1%-17.6%. At inclinations less than 50$\,^{\circ}$, the fractional polarization depends mostly on the ratio of random to regular magnetic field strength. At higher inclinations, Faraday depolarization associated with the regular magnetic field becomes more important. The observed degree of polarization is lower (<4%) for more luminous galaxies, in particular those with L 4.8 > 2 × 1021 W Hz-1. The polarization angle of the integrated emission is aligned with the apparent minor axis of the disk for galaxies without a bar. In our axially symmetric models, the polarization angle of the integrated emission is independent of wavelength. Simulated distributions of fractional polarization for randomly oriented spiral galaxies at 4.8 GHz and 1.4 GHz are presented. We conclude that polarization measurements, e.g., with the Square Kilometre Array, of unresolved spiral galaxies allow statistical studies of the magnetic field in disk galaxies using large samples in the local universe and at high redshift. As these galaxies behave as idealized background sources without internal Faraday rotation, they can be used to detect large-scale magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium.},

abstract = {Observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS) provide a unique opportunity to explore the fundamental properties of neutrinos. We report on how recent observations of the small angular-scale CMB provide us with an improved ability to constrain the neutrino background rest-frame sound speed, c_eff^2, and the viscosity parameter, c_vis^2. For a standard neutrino background these parameters both equal 1/3. A combination of CMB and LSS data gives c_eff^2 = 0.30 +0.035 -0.039 and c_vis^2 = 0.31 +0.3 -0.19 at the 95% confidence level. Fundamentally these constraints allow us to quantify the extent to which neutrinos are non-interacting around the time of the formation of structure in the CMB. We also discuss how constraints to these parameters from future observations (such as the Planck satellite) will allow us to explore the fundamental properties of any anomalous radiative energy density beyond the standard three neutrinos.},
